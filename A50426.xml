         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THe Subject of this Treatiſe being the Juſtification of a ſinner is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weighty, the ſame things being made in the Scripture the conditions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Juſtification and Salvation; and yet this weighty ſubject is exceedingly contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. A thing of ill and dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence! If I had therefore any thing to produce that was new and ſound upon this argument, which might ſerve for the healing of the breaches that are amongſt us, I might be very well excuſed for increaſing the vaſt number of Books by adding one more.</p>
            <p>There are no leſs then four ſeveral opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt good men touching the matter of Juſtification, or the condition of it; two of which I may term extream, the other two middle or moderate Opinions.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who, becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſputes againſt Legal Works, baniſh all conſideration of Works, though the moſt Evangelical and
<pb facs="tcp:64817:4"/>rightly principled, from having any place at all in our Juſtification. Amongſt theſe <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf will be found to be a chief Leader, though otherwiſe an eminent ſervant of God. And that I do not accuſe him falſly, let ſuch paſſages as theſe witneſs for me, that are to be found in his Commentary upon the <hi>Galatians</hi> (in which he layes that diſtinction of Righteouſneſs into active and paſſive, as the foundation of all his building in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification, and ſo makes the righteouſneſs of the Goſpel, by which we are juſtified, to be only a paſſive righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) Pag. 10. of his Commentary printed at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> 1535.
<q>
                  <hi>Ego non quaero Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam activam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deberem quidem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:64817:4"/>eſt neſcire legem, ignorare legem, &amp; TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAM juſtitiam activam;</hi> that is, It is the greateſt art and wiſedom of a Chriſtian not to know, or own the Law, Works, or any ſuch thing as active righteouſneſs in the matter of Juſtification.</q> Here you ſee he excludes all kinde of Works whatſoever. So again, pag. 11.
<q>
                  <hi>Haec eſt noſtra Theologia, &amp;c.</hi> that is, This is our Divinity, by which we teach accurately to diſtinguiſh between theſe two righteouſneſſes active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; that Faith and Manners may not be confounded, Works and Grace. But to mention no more, ſee pag. 12. <hi>Nihil ergo facimus nos? Nihil operamur ad hanc juſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am conſequendam? Reſpondeo nihil;</hi> What then do we do nothing? Do we work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards the obtaining of this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs?

<pb facs="tcp:64817:5"/>
               <q>That we muſt go to Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that the Law cannot ſave us, that we muſt not tamper with the Law in the matter of Juſtification, we muſt <hi>ignorare legem, neſcire legem,</hi> be wholly ignorant of and diſown the Law in the matter of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</q> Theſe are all good expreſſions, were it not for their companions, ſuch as theſe:
<q>I caſt my ſelf <hi>extra totam juſtitiam activam,</hi> out <hi>OF ALL ACTIVE</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>&amp; meam &amp; divinae Legis,</hi> that is, All of one kinde or another Legal or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, ſo it be active righteouſneſs.</q> So again,
<q>That I ſimply embrace a paſſive righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſuch as we do not do but ſuffer.</q> 
               <hi>What will be ſaid then to Faith it ſelf? Surely we act it not ſuffer it only, and that is our Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi> Again, <hi>to ſhut out MANNERS out of Justification is ſtrange.</hi> But the worſt expreſſion of all is that laſt quoted,
<q>What then do we do nothing? Do we work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards the obtaining our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I anſwer nothing: Becauſe <hi>THIS</hi> Goſpel-<hi>RIGHTEOUSNESS IS INDEED TO DO NOTHING, BUT ONLY TO BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEVE THAT CHRIST IS GONE TO THE FATHER,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Neither can theſe paſſages of <hi>Luther</hi> be interpreted of the firſt juſtification of a Sinner upon his firſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (which I wiſh they could) that there
<pb facs="tcp:64817:5"/>faith juſtifies without works; which one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly, yet truly, expreſſeth thus; <hi>Fides foeta juſtificat ante partum,</hi> that faith, though it have only an obediential frame and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in it to do good works, yet, effectually juſtifies at firſt converſion before ſuch good works are brought forth. I ſay <hi>Luthers</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions cannot be taken in this ſenſe, for he manifeſtly ſpeaks of the whole life and practice of a Chriſtian or Saint of God, in his treating with God for his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and pardon at any time. <hi>Ego non quaer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In <hi>pag.</hi> 10. he takes men off, when they come to dye, from taking their comfort or diſcomfort from their paſt life (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, if ever they were juſtifyed is the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt time after their firſt Juſtification) without any diſtinction about it; whereas we finde, that when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> came to die, and had

<pb facs="tcp:64817:7"/>comfort we may be able to conclude to our ſelves from the imperfect obedience of our paſt lives. But yet believe it, he that then ſhall have the teſtimony of a clear conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the fair appearance or apparition of a good paſt life, or <hi>active righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo as to be able to uſe the words of good <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> unto the Lord, <hi>Remember how I have done that which was goad in thy ſight,</hi> will have no occaſion to turn from it as a foul ſpectre or ghaſtly apparition; but he will rather welcome it as his good Angel, and deſire it's company with him into the other world: for upon this account it is that <hi>they are bleſſed that dye in the Lord, for that they rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and THEIR WORKS FOLLOW THEM,</hi> Rev. 14.13. I might adde many other paſſages out of <hi>Luther</hi> and others, but theſe may ſuffice to ſhew the firſt extream opinion in the buſineſs of Juſtification, that Works of no kinde have any thing to do there at all.</p>
            <p>The other extream Opinion of ſome good men, is. That the righteouſneſs of faith is an holy temper of heart, or a Chriſt-like nature in a man's ſoul, which, becauſe it is produced very much by faith, it is called <hi>the righteouſneſs of faith.</hi> Now certainly theſe bend the ſtick too much the other way; for though Holineſs be requiſite unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:64817:7"/>yet it is not the only requiſite, nor the chief condition of it, upon which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is put by God. Yet this Opinion I look upon to be much ſafer than the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Doctrine.</p>
            <p>As for the two middle Opinions, that hold the mean betwixt theſe two extreams, they are that of Mr <hi>John Goodwin</hi> and Mr <hi>Baxter;</hi> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> allowes Evangelical works a ſhare in Juſtification, but then it is only in that part or kinde of Juſtification which conſiſts in the divine approbation, but excludes them out of that part or that kinde of Juſtification which conſiſts in remiſsion of ſins, which yet he affirmes is the ſtrict Goſpel-juſtification; and for this, he makes faith alone to be the condition of it.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> makes Faith and Evangelical Works together the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat condition of that Juſtification which conſiſts in pardon of ſins, as well as of the divine approbation, only that Faith is the principal, Works the laſt principal conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to this Opinion I muſt needs adhere. Though for Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> I look upon it to be ſufficiently removed from the <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> in that it makes Faith as an act not only as a hand receiving Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (as ſome Antinomians love to ſpeak) the condition of Juſtification, and
<pb facs="tcp:64817:8"/>Works too to be neceſſary unto the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining divine approbation; beſides, that he holds that the final Juſtification at the day of Judgment ſhall proceed according to Works. And indeed I am ſo farr of his opinion, that I think faith hath a farr grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhare in our Juſtification, than all our good Works put together; yea, that our good Works do chiefly juſtifye as they have faith in them, and for the ſake of that faith that ſpirits them, of which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſome proof in the enſuing Treatiſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 270, 271. out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. where the Apoſtle ſindes out a faith in the actions of ſeveral of the Patriarchs, and ſayes it was by faith that they did this or that and were juſtified, though their ſtory mention nothing of their faith at all. And it may be ſaid as well that Works without Faith are dead being alone, as that <hi>Faith without Works is dead being alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe four Opinions lying fair in view, in all which, there are good men enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, &amp; in ſome of them to a great heat of contention; it were a worthy deſign (in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man that were able) to endeavour their reconciliation to each other, (if all means have not been uſed) and eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is no other thing requiſite in order to it, but a right ſtate of this or theſe two queſtions, Whether, and, if ſo, How
<pb facs="tcp:64817:8"/>farr Evangelical Works have an influence upon the juſtification of a ſinner? I ſay, there is nothing elſe neceſſary to the ending of the controverſies between all theſe, but the ſtating of this queſtion, and the honeſt attending to ſuch a ſtate given: For that all the parties agree upon the ſame things for matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That we muſt believe, and that we muſt do good Works and that to our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; only one ſaith Evangelical Works have a ſhare in our juſtification; another ſayes they have none; one ſayes they ſignifie ſo much, another but ſo much, none deny that good works are to be done. I might mention another difference in opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith in juſtification, and that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what kinde of faith it is that is the condition of our juſtification; whether only that faith that hath a direct and expreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt and his death, or elſe all acts of faith whatſoever upon the power, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and faithfulneſs of God, as well as that upon Chriſt and his blood. I hope I have in ſome of theſe things added one mire at leaſt unto the treaſury of Knowledg, or elſe I were very impertinent indeed.</p>
            <p>But this was not my deſign in compoſing this Treatiſe, to give a ſtate of ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore what I have done of ſuch a kinde, I have caſt at the end of my Book,
<pb facs="tcp:64817:9"/>as not being chiefly intended, nor indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at all at firſt, but only as I found that it would be neceſsary to ſay ſomething upon them.</p>
            <p>Or if I had deſired to engage in ſuch a deſigne, theſe ſeveral reaſons might have diſcouraged me: <hi>First,</hi> that it required vaſt abilities to undertake it; <hi>Secondly,</hi> That I thought it had been very well performed by Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> already; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That though any ſhould be judiciouſly ſatisfied, that he could give a better ſtate than yet had been given, he might very well doubt how it would be entertained amongſt the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> (of whom I have heard a very learned and godly Perſon ſay of late, That he would ſhine in heaven for his book of Aphoriſmes) yet by it purchaſed the higheſt diſpleaſure from his <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brethren.</p>
            <p>My deſign therefore was wholly of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature; for obſerving that the Subject was as well practical and experimental as diſputable (though there are very worthy and lofty ſpeculations to be had about it) I thought it the moſt efficacious way of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſputes about it, at leaſt of making it uſefull to honeſt men (leaving diſputers to themſelves) to ſhew how it was practical and experimental, and by how much the ſhorrer
<pb facs="tcp:64817:9"/>I was in my doctrine upon this Subject, to be ſo much the larger in my applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And indeed I muſt needs ſay I obſerved, as I thought, that thoſe who had hitherto written upon this Subject were deficient in one great piece of Application. Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> and others I thought had done excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice againſt the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who have ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked them in theſe late times both in the Pulpit and Preſs, and their private ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and inſinuations: but then they were more ſparing in uſing the two-edged ſword of Truth in this Subject on that ſide where it ſhould cut the Legaliſt: whereas there was as much or more need to ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as againſt the <hi>Antinomian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we would learn what Legality was that we might avoid it, we muſt go to the <hi>Antinomians;</hi> there was little to be heard of this Subject amongſt others; though in the mean time they did moſt dangerouſly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon their Auditors and Diſciples with falſe deſcriptions of Legality; ſo that I have my ſelf, whileſt formerly an <hi>Antinomian</hi> and an Enthuſiaſt, looked upon that to be as ugly as Hell and Damnation, which I now receive for good, wholſom, and precious Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal truth; I could well have approved of that ſaying of <hi>Luther</hi> formerly, <hi>Operatores

                  </gap>li,</hi> that is, That thoſe that do minde Works in the matter of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though Evangelical works, ſo farr as they minde them, they are the Devils Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and bear their teſtimony by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes of their ſpirit againſt the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Goſpel; and yet from ſuch Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers we muſt receive the notes of Legality, others that are enemies to the <hi>Antinomians</hi> not offering at this Subject, at leaſt in that profeſſed way as the <hi>Antinomians</hi> do.</p>
            <p>This I looked upon to be a conſiderable defect, eſpecially when I obſerved that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> as alſo in ſome other places, lets out the chief of his zeal,
<note place="margin">Rom. 61, 2. <hi>VVhat ſhal we ſay then? ſhall we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in ſin that grace may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as I ſaid even now, this Subject is a practical Subject, and highly experimental, yea every whit, and rather more experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the inconveniences of Legality, than of thoſe of Antinomianſme, <hi>For the Law and Grace contend for the dominion and maſtery in every heart that but entertains the thoughts of Religion.</hi> Now where the notion of Grace prevails in a right way, there is the right

For the Legaliſt that depends upon his external Priviledges or performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is not ſo eaſily beaten out of his hold, as the <hi>Antinomian</hi> that is deſtructively ſo, that is, a Libertine; (for there is a partial Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm as well as a partial Legality that is not deſtructive) becauſe he falls under an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie &amp; obvious conviction (except he have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:64817:11"/>a brawny conſcience) for that his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages are more groſs, whereas a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts faults are hidden and ſpiritual:</p>
            <p>However I am ſure there is both for the number of Legaliſts and their uſual roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs in that diſtemper reaſon for equal proviſion to be made about them to what there is to be made about the <hi>Antinomians.</hi> Now finding that there was not, at leaſt not finding that there was equal care taken, I adventured to ſay ſomething about it; I wiſh I may provoke ſome other to do it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; they ſhall have my hearty prayers to the Lord for their aſſiſtance in ſuch a work.</p>
            <p>And beſides theſe ſeveral reaſons which I have mentioned, as moving me to the compoſing of this Treatiſe, eſpecially that part of it which conſiſts of the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, there was another very prevailing with me, &amp; it was my own neceſſity of being well enlightened about this matter. For I found dayly uſe uſe of ſome of the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I have here given thee, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayer, yea in the mannagement of my ſpirit all the day long. I found the Law ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to get the maſtery of my ſpirit, that is, <hi>ſin by the</hi> (ſeverity of the) <hi>commandem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:64817:11"/>to be averſe unto him and his wayes, yea to conceive a profeſſed diſpleaſure againſt God himſelf, till I have been relieved by ſome of theſe conſiderations which I here tender un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee for the ſame end, with an earneſt prayer that they may do thy ſoul good, as I hope they have done mine.</p>
            <p>And I doubt not, but <hi>Luther</hi> being a good man, and one of a great ſpirit, had a conſiderable and worthy deſign in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get the Law out of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as his phraſe is, I mean getting it from its dominion over him, though he might herein over-do it, as it is certain he did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak it.

            <p>Not to inſiſt upon the ſtile, which is grave, and yet pleaſant enough, and at a due diſtance from affectation; the argument, or theme undertaken in the Book, The Juſtification of a ſinner, is, both of as important and neceſſary, and of as ſublime and difficult a contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at leaſt in many of the veines or branches of it, as any other ſubject within the circumference of Divinity, or <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Yea, whereas in the beſt and moſt ſerviceable of the years of my earthly Pilgrimage, I have been (by the providence of God) occaſionally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to wade ſomewhat farr in the deep waters of thoſe two myſterious Articles of the Common Faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to inquire into and conſider, with the beſt of my

            <p>Not having had time to peruſe the Treatiſe ſince the printing of it, nor any other knowledg of the contents of it, but only what I gained by ſome broken communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about them with the Author, when his leiſure and mine could agree, (which was not very often) whileſt he was preparing it for the Preſs, I am not able to give thee a ſteady account how farr he hath traverſed his Subject, or about how many of the <hi>arcana,</hi> or difficult Queries relating to it he hath engaged his pen in the preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. I ſuppoſe it never came near his thoughts, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs ſo ſmall a Tract in all the inquireable points about Juſtification (nor do I know any man, amongſt thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have ſerved the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World in that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that have raiſed the pitch of their Undertaking ſo high.) But I well remember he hath laboured very commendably, and to the good contentment (I doubt not) of the conſciences of thoſe that ſhall conſeientiouſly reade and minde what he hath written, in ſundry particulars, very neceſſary to be underſtood by thoſe that are deſirous
<pb facs="tcp:64817:15"/>to know the <hi>whole counſel</hi> of God in that Great and moſt important Article of their moſt holy Profeſſion (I mean, Juſtification.)

This Error being ſo broad-fac'd and palpable, had need have the countenance of ſome, that are <hi>counted Pillars</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church to ſupport it.

               </gap>t of this kinde, both the face and heart of it are ſet to deprive the world of the spirit, life, and ſoul of all that the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath written in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, in aſſerting the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith against the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all others oppoſing it: which is a good part (not to ſay the beſt, or gredteſt part) of all the heavenly Legatie, which he hath left in writing unto the world, for that Love's ſake which he bare in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to the ſalvation of it. For if the great conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his Oppanents (the <hi>Jews</hi>) was not about Juſtification it ſelf, or about the means, whereby it is to be obtained in the ſight of God, but onely about the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, or declarative of it, and this before men, which they muſt of neceſſity affirm, that hold men really and actually juſtified by God from eternity; then (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) the <hi>Jews,</hi> who pleaded for Justification by Works, had the better end of the ſtaff; inaſmuch as theſe have a greater declarative force, at leaſt in reference unto men, of the ſtate of Juſtification, or of the acceptance of a perſon with God, than Faith hath. This, not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and experience onely, but the Scripture it ſelf ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb facs="tcp:64817:15"/>from place to place, ſtill making waies and works of Righteouſneſs, and fruitfulneſs in well-doing, the moſt unqueſtionable Characters and proofs of perſons ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and in favour with God. Places of this import, and very pregnantly ſuch, might ſoon be drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great numbers; but I judg this needleſs, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the frequent and familiar occurrencie of ſuch places. Whereas <hi>Faith</hi> is here repreſented, as in, and of, it ſelf, inevident, and as ſtanding in need of the light of Works, to make it viſible or manifeſt unto men, <hi>Jam. 2.18. 1 Joh. 37.10. Rom. 8.1.</hi> Beſides, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he is more large in the vindication of his Doctrine concerning Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith, then elſewhere in any place, ſpeaketh expreſly of the <hi>conſtituting [i. e.</hi> of the actual making] of men juſt, or righteous, <hi>c. 5.19.</hi> [that is, the inveſting men with the ſtate of Justification] but no where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth any thing concerning the manifeſtation of ſuch a ſtate. And the truth is, that the conteſt about <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> wherein be ingaged againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> with ſo much zeal, ſo much ardencie of deſire to convince them, with ſuch variety of exquiſite and ponderous arguing, to bring the truth to light, againſt which they contended with him; the conteſt (I ſay) had hardly been worth all this <hi>oleum &amp; opera,</hi> all this ſolemnitie, and height of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement by ſuch a man, had it been onely about the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, and not about the way and means of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a juſtified eſtate. An account of this aſſertion might be given, if need were.</p>
            <p>Another thing worthy conſideration about the great Subject of the Treatiſe, is, whether, &amp; if ſo, why juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Forgiveneſs of ſins, is aſcribed, as well to ſuch acts of Faith, which do not, at leaſt directly, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, relate unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or unto the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as unto theſe which do. Thou wilt ſinde here more produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

For it doth not bear hard at all, either upon the Wiſedom of God, or upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his words in the Scripture, to conceive, that any act from a believing frame or dispoſition of ſoul in man towards God, ſhould reduce him under the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Juſtification, and ſo intereſſe him in the benefit or bleſſing hereof; conſidering, that every ſuch act doth <hi>arguitive</hi> (as the School-men ſpeak) that is, virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſequentially, comprehend in it ſuch an act of believing alſo, which is directly and immediately acted upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his death. It is a rule in the Civil Law, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>avores ſunt ampliandi;</hi> the meaning is, that ſuch paſſages or clauſes in the Law which were intended in way of favour or benefit unto men, ought to be interpreted in the largeſt and moſt comprehenſive ſenſe that the words will any way bear: as on the other hand there is this rule, <hi>In odioſis ſtricte facienda eſt interpretatio;</hi> Such ſayings in the Law, which concern the puniſhment of perſons, in one kind or other, are to be underſtood in as narrow and reſtrained a ſenſe as the words will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Doubtleſs theſe notions for the expounding of Laws, both in the one caſe and the other, are equitable, agreeable to reaſon and the light of nature; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are to be found in the nature of God himſelf, who (as the Scripture informeth us) made man in his own image, or likeneſs; and veſted the ſame, or the like principles, or impreſſions, of Reaſon, Equity, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in him, with thoſe that were in himſelf. So that it need be no great matter of wonder that God ſhould be very indulgent and large in interpreting ſuch clauſes
<pb facs="tcp:64817:16"/>in the Gospel, which relate unto the juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of men, and (conſequently) ſhould finde juſtifying Faith in ſuch acts of believing, which may any waies, even by the moſt abſtruſe, ſubtile, or profound way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, be conceived to evince or comprehend it.</p>
            <p>Whether upon every reiterated or repeated act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, the believer is juſtified afreſh; if ſo, what doth a ſupervenient act of Juſtification profit him that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſtified already? or how is there place for the effect of ſuch an act, as that of Juſtification in him, all whoſe ſins, by means of his being in Chriſt are already pardoned by God? or if not, what ſhould be the reaſon why one act of the ſame Faith ſhould not juſtifie, as well as another? Are problemes worthy the conſideration and inquiry of an ingenuous Student in the myſterious ſcience of Juſtification? Theſe alſo or ſome of them, are ingeniouſly diſcuſſed, and endeavoured to be reſolved in this Treatiſe. Doubtleſs every new act of believing doth not procure or bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that ſo acteth a new juſtification (properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and which conſiſteth in remiſſion of ſins.) Nor is this any disparagement to an after-act of believing, in compariſon of any former, or the firſt act in this kinde, by which Juſtification in this ſenſe was obtained, nor doth it argue any whit leſs acceptance of it with God. For as the ſaying in natural Philoſophy is, <hi>Quiequid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis,</hi> the qualification, or condition of the Subject, doth often, if not alwaies, modifie the effect of the act that is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or acted upon it: So he, who by virtue of a former act of believing remains and is in a complete ſtate of Justification, all his ſins being forgiven him by God, is not capable of receiving the forgiveneſs of them (at leaſt in the ſame ſenſe, or kind) the ſecond time, becauſe he needeth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not. For it being unpoſſible for God, in respect of the infinity of his Wiſedom, to do any thing ſuperſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb facs="tcp:64817:17"/>no creature can be in a regular capacity of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any matter of grace or favour from him, unleſs in one respect or other it ſtandeth in need of it. Every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated act of Faith doth (indeed) obtain from God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> I mean, <hi>Approbation;</hi> which is oft in Scripture expreſſed, and this without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great acyrology, or impropriety of ſpeech, by the word <hi>Juſtification.</hi> For though men were approved of him before, as well as <hi>juſtified,</hi> yet Approbation being ſuſceptive of <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> or of degrees, which <hi>Juſtification,</hi> ſtrictly taken, is not; they may be oft ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, yet not often (in that ſenſe) juſtified (their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer juſtification remaining.) That <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> teacheth us to ask of God dayly, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the continuation of the firſt act whereby he juſtified us, which it is meet we ſhould ask of him, in respect of our new and dayly tranſgreſſions; or (which I rather conceive, yet with ſubmiſſion) Gods forbearing to puniſh us with temporal puniſhments for our dayly ſins, being at liberty we know) thus to puniſh us, notwithſtanding our juſtified eſtate, if he be not intreated by us in this respect to forgive us.

His zeal in the caſe is very pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if not commendable rather, the matter being exceeding weighty: For if that be all the <hi>Juſtification</hi> we receive from God, to be pronounced juſt, or righteous by him, according to that righteouſneſs, which he ſeeth truly and really inherent in us, and for the ſame, what becomes of our ſins? Are theſe ſtill reteined and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given? Or if they be forgiven, is the forgiveneſs of them nothing, no part of our <hi>Juſtification?</hi> And if they be forgiven, are they forgiven for the ſake of that inherent righteouſneſs, for, and according unto, which (ſaith the Opinion) God pronounceth us righteous, that is juſtifieth us? Doth not this notion wholly evacuate the firſt-born <hi>inter Magnalia Dei,</hi> the moſt adorable Vouchſaſement, that ever the Grace, and Love, or Bounty of God iſſued forth unto the world; I mean, the propitiatory Sucrifice of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Beſides, if God ſhall pronounce us righteous onely for, and according to that righteouſneſs which he ſeeth and knoweth to be in us, and this be our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> the Grace of God will have but a ſaint and feeble hand in our <hi>Juſtification.</hi> For it is but a kinde of debt for him, that certainly knoweth another man to be righteous, to give teſtimory unto him accordingly, and to pronounce him ſuch upon occaſion. But for the further eviction of this ſo Anti-Evangelical a notion, I referr thee to the Treatiſe it ſelf. Onely (if thou pleaſeſt) bear me a few words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what I conceive may be the occaſion (at leaſt in part) of the ſad miſtake. When God in the Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:64817:18"/>calleth or pronounceth men <hi>righteous</hi> for, and according to, that righteouſneſs which is really and truly veſted in them. 1. He speaketh not of an abſolute, diſtrict and perfect righteouſneſs, or ſuch which without any more ade, giveth them a right of claim to Heaven, but firſt, of ſuch a righteouſneſs which is inchoate only, and wants many degrees of its perfect growth and ſtature, admitting no ſmall mixture of unrighteouſneſs with it, according to theſe, and many like Scriptures: <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. <hi>3.2. If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, &amp;c. 1</hi> Joh. <hi>1.8.10. Who can underſtand his errors? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults,</hi> Pſal. <hi>19.12. There is not a juſt man on earth that doth good and ſinneth not,</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>7.20. There is no man that ſinneth not, 1</hi> King. <hi>8.46. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> He ſpeaketh of a comparative <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> pronouncing the Saints <hi>righteous,</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of the world, which as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, lyeth in wickedneſs. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God pronounceth Believers righteous for, and according to that good and righteous frame of heart which he ſeeth in them, he doth not juſtifie them in the ſenſe of the word <hi>Juſtifie,</hi> in the Queſtions and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about the juſtification of a ſinner, namely, <hi>ſenſu forenſi,</hi> as perſons are ſaid to be juſtified from Crimes laid to their charge by a Judge; but <hi>ſenſu morali,</hi> as when perſons that are <hi>approved</hi> by whomſoever, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing either done by them, or known or ſuppoſed to he in them, are ſaid to be <hi>juſtified</hi> by them. The word <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie</hi> is frequently uſed in this ſenſe in the Scriptures. <hi>Job 27.5, 33.32, 11.2. Prov. 17.15.</hi> compared with Ch. <hi>24.34, &amp; 28.4. Matt. 11.19. Luke 7.35. Matth. 12.37.</hi> (with many others.) Whereas when God is ſaid to <hi>juſtifie</hi> thoſe that believe, with that Juſtification which is ſaid to be of, or <hi>unto life,</hi> ({<hi>i.e.</hi> unto ſalvation) <hi>Rom. 5.18.</hi> he is ſaid <hi>to forgive their iniquities, to cover their ſins, not to impute ſin unto them, &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:64817:18"/>Rom. 4.5.</hi> compared with <hi>6.7, 8. Acts 13.38.</hi> with <hi>39</hi> See alſo <hi>Eph. 1.7. Col. 1.14. Luke 1.77. Rom. 3.25.</hi> with <hi>8.26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> is (indeed) a moſt abſolute, diſtrict &amp; compleat righteouſneſs [in its kind] having no mixture or tincture of any weakneſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in it; and, as to the benefit and comfort of all that receive it, comprehending in it the conſtant obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the whole Law of God to every the leaſt iota or tittle of it. In respect of this moſt exquiſite, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and divine perfection of it, as well as in others, it may well be term'd (as it is <hi>Rom. 3.21, 22.</hi> twice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF God.</hi> It is like the non-advertency of theſe particulars might render the Judgements of ſome learned men the more obnoxious to the error now impleaded.</p>
            <p>Yet further, he that deſires to underſtand himſelf like a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in ſo material a piece of his profeſſion, as <hi>Juſtification,</hi> had need be able and expert to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the terms, and phraſes, which frequently occur in the Scriptures relating to it, out of their ambiguities and diverſities of ſignifications and imports; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to know when different words or expreſſions are the ſame in ſence and import, either expreſsly, or implicitly, and by conſequence, otherwiſe they will never ſit eaſia and light ſome in their judgment about many particulars belonging to it. I muſt not ſtand to inſtance in particulars; I have already exceeded the intended proportion of my Advertiſement. But in this concernment alſo thou wilt find the Treatiſe at hand a good Benefactor unto thee: This will inform thee, that the word <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> doth not always ſignifie the principle or virtue of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs inherent in the ſoul, but ſometimes that which we may call an adherent, or a relative righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> a non-imputation of ſin, or the forgiveneſs of ſin, called alſo (as we lately ſhewed) the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> that is,
<pb facs="tcp:64817:19"/>which is obtained by Faith. So again, it will acquaint thee with different ſignifications of the words, <hi>Juſt, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, Juſtification,</hi> and ſome others; by the knowledge whereof the rough wayes of the ſtudy of Juſtification will be made ſmooth.</p>
            <p>But the carriages or paſſages of the Treatiſe hitherto pointed at, are (in the eye of my comparing faculty) but as <hi>Pictures of Silver,</hi> the <hi>Apple of Gold</hi> amongſt them; and which to me is <hi>vena baſilica,</hi> the Maſter-Vein of the Diſcourſe, is that quarter of it in which the Evangelical purity and ſimplicity of Juſtification is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted againſt the importune, yet ſubtile and cloſe inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a legal ſpirit. For as I know no Doctrine greater then that of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> within the whole Hemiſphere of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſion (as before was hinted) ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I apprehend any thing more threatning the world with the loſs of the great benefit and bleſſing of this great Doctrine, then that <gap reason="foreign">

Why, this Juſtification of a mans perſon, it is done in the ſight
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64817:22"/>of God; and (that I may a little illuſtrate it) it ſeems to be done in the Court of Heaven, before all tht Augels of God; for they re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oice at the converſion of a Sinner, and ſo at his Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.8, 9.15.10. Therefore in the Court of Heaven, when one is to be juſtified, the great inquiry that is made, is after a Righteouſneſs: And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles when he treats of this ſubject, ring of nothing ſo loudly as of a Righteouſneſs: No leſs then thirty ſeveral time doth the Apoſtle make mention of that Word <hi>Rightcouſneſs,</hi> in that one Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> and and at leaſt twenty of thoſe times it is referred unto <hi>Juſtification;</hi> therefore <hi>Juſtification</hi> muſt be by a <hi>Righteonſneſs:</hi> The great Queſtion therefore is this; What is the Righteouſneſs which if a man have, he is a Subject capable of being juſtified, that is, reputed a juſt man in the ſight of God? Now the Anſwer to this Queſtion cannot be made, till I have eſtabliſhed four preliminary Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>The firſt poſition is this, That there are only two kinds of righteouſneſs imaginable by us; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or rather, but two to be found in Scripture; &amp; they are by the Apoſtle fairly diſtinguiſhed, &amp; each part of the diſtinction expreſſed in ſeveral ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes, or words ſignifying the ſame thing. There is the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5.6. The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and our own Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. And as Righteouſneſs is thus variouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, ſo is Juſtification (which is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Righteouſneſs) ſaid to be of ſeveral kinds, according to the ſeveral Righteouſneſs which it proceeds upon; (if the Righteouſneſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64817:23"/>be that of the Law, by the Works of the Law, then is the Reward reckoned of Debt; if the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs be that of Faith, the Reward is in the nature of a Grace or Gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 4. Now to him that worketh (according to the Law) the Reward is not reckoned of Grace, but of Debt, and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> contra,</hi> to him that believeth, and is for the Righteouſneſs of Faith, the Reward, that is, Juſtification, is reckoned of Grace, not of Debt. Having thus given a diſtinct account what Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is, how that it is the conſtituting a man juſt before God; and what ground or reaſon it proceeds upon, <hi>viz.</hi> Upon a Righteouſneſs found with the perſon to be juſtified; he hath a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to plead for him: And having given you the onely diſtinction that there is of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is of the Law, or Faith; however either part of the diſtinction may be varied in ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous expreſſions; and ſo the Juſtification follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon one of theſe Righteouſneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Law is of Debt; upon the other, <hi>viz.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of Faith is of Grace; I ſhall draw up the terms that belong to either part of the diſtinction, whether of Righteouſneſs or Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, together, that ſo ye may ſee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is full of theſe two, and only theſe two; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the Scriptures may appear wherein this ſubject is touched at, and ſo fall upon a fair di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute for the Cauſe, which is this, Whether of theſe two ways muſt ſerve us in the preſent ſtate of things? Which way of Righteouſneſs, which way of Juſtification we muſt betake our ſelves unto, if we would be ſaved? For without Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, no Salvation; and Salvation at the day of Judgement will follow onely upon our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64817:23"/>in this life; God will then do that in the face of all the world in acquitting or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which now he doth effectually in a more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and ſecret manner. To draw up (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) theſe two parties into the field. 1. The Law in its party or liſt of Synonyma's, hath theſe ſeverals, <hi>The works of the Law,</hi> 2 <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>The deeds of the Law, Rom.</hi> 3.20.28. <hi>The Law of Works,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>By works,</hi> without any addition of <hi>the Law.</hi> If <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified <hi>by works,</hi> he hath whereof <hi>to glory,</hi> Rom. 4.2. Here <hi>glorying</hi> and <hi>boaſting</hi> belong to this Tribe too, as a conſequent upon Legal-Juſtification, or Law-Juſtification. The Verb uſed is this, <hi>To him that</hi> worketh. I ſhall not inſtance in any further Synonyma's belonging to the Law, ſuch as this, that it is called a fleſhly way, and fleſh; <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh, having begun in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are ye now made perfect by the fleſh.</hi> I come to give the ſynonymaes or conjugata that belong to the way of Faith: The ſubſtantives are theſe, 1. <hi>Faith</hi> alone; <hi>Faith</hi> was <hi>reckoned to</hi> Abraham <hi>for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Faith of God, Rom.</hi> 3.3. <hi>The Law of Faith,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>The righteouſneſs of faith:</hi> Rom. 4.13. Grace 'tis <hi>of Faith,</hi> that it might be <hi>of Grace. Abundance of Grace,</hi> and <hi>the gift of righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 5.17. It is alſo called the Promiſe. <hi>Faith</hi> then is made void, &amp; <hi>the Promiſe</hi> made of none effect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14. And laſtly, to mention no more <hi>the Promiſes;</hi> is the Law then againſt the Promiſes of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. the verbs, To him that <hi>worketh not,</hi> but <hi>believeth,</hi> his <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>counted</hi> unto him for <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> Having given this Muſter-Roll as it were) of both parties, I come now to ſome other Poſitions, the firſt was this <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That there are but theſe two ways (imaginable of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64817:24"/>fication; there are but two ſorts of Righteouſneſs, and ſo but two ways by which men do, or with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reaſon can ſeek Juſtification in, elſe there had been more mentioned by the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>The ſecond poſition is this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. That theſe two wayes are quite oppoſite one to the other, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtent one with the other, that is, as to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of the ſame man, at the ſame time; nay if a man doth but ſeek to be juſtified by the one, he cannot be juſtified by the other at the ſame time: This oppoſition I have argued out for me expreſly by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>If by Grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace; but if it be by works then it is no more of Grace, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>herwiſe work is no more work,</hi> Rom. 4.4, 5. Now to him that <hi>worketh</hi> is the <hi>reward,</hi> not <hi>reckoned</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> but <hi>of Debt;</hi> but to him that <hi>worketh not,</hi> but <hi>believeth,</hi> his Faith is <hi>counted for righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3d. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Poſition is this; The way of works was once, and ſtill in its own nature is a way of juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10. <hi>The Commandment was ordained to be unto life;</hi> yea, this way was the ancient, and the firſt of the ways of God in his dealing with man, and ſeems to be natural, and neceſſary to the primitive Eſtate of mankind; For God made made man upright in his own Image, of knowledg, righteouſneſs, and true holineſs, and gave him the Law, though not written in Tables of ſtone, yet in his heart, which was better; elſe it had not been ſinne to have committed Murther, Adultery, Stealth, falſe-witneſs bearing, Perjury, Idolatry, and what not, in the Eſtate of innocency; for <hi>where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God gave man a Law, and ſurniſhed him with abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to have hept it to a tittle; ſo that, if he would, he

Thus we ſee Juſtification is a a thing feaſible and attainable by works; by the Law, if a man have the works of it:
<note place="margin">Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and the elect Augels were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, our Saviour Chriſt had the Works of the Law, and the Law juſtified him; and the Angels that kept their firſt eſtate, they were doubtleſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64817:25"/>by the Law of their Creation, and had all the Apoſtate Angels turned Devils and falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of them, as they are of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> their Works would have juſtified them in the ſight of God,
<note place="margin">Not that the good Angels had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward but what a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> and before the world; though I ſay not that the good Angels have no other reward but what a Covenant of works allots. But I doubt not to affirm, That the good Angels were juſtified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by a Covenant of Works; in as much as there was a full trial made, when the other Angels fell of their voluntary obedience: So that the Law in it ſelf, hath not only a power to juſtifie and reward, but hath actually rewarded the obſervers of it, thoſe that had the righteouſneſs of it: Yea all the Work of our redemption by Chriſt, was brought about onely with the good leave of the Law: Chriſt muſt make a recognition, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely own the Authority and Majeſty that was ſtill remaining in the Law: acknowledgement muſt be made how that that had been offended; and ſome reparation muſt be made unto the glory of God, which was much impaired; as it is a revenue from us, in the tranſgreſſion of the Law: And this was the onely way decreed by God, that the Law muſt ſatisfie it ſelf upon him, whoſoever would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our Redemption; and then the Law muſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie him; all which it did upon our Saviour: Which proves the unqueſtionable Power and Authority that the Law had in it to juſtifie man, had he but the works of it.</p>
            <p>But now let any man or Angel but ſin,
<note place="margin">If the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aw be once bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a tittle, it can juſtifie no longer.</note> and the Law can juſtifie him no longer; if he have but the leaſt failing in obedience, the Law can onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this perſon, Man or Angel, whoever he be; but I ſhall limit my ſelf to mankind: For this take
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64817:25"/>that Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10 <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> So that if a man hath once ſinned, and yet ſeeks to be juſtified, he muſt not ſeek juſtification by the righteouſneſs of the Law any longer; there comes a neceſſity of Grace, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Mercy, which the Law hath not in it; the Law hath no ſuch thing as Grace or Pardon in it. The Law onely ſaith, <hi>He that doth them, ſhall live in them;</hi> and <hi>he that doth them not, is accurſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Grace, Mercy and Pardon which a man comes to have a neceſſity of, upon his firſt breach of the Law, is in the way of Faith, which I have proved to be the oppoſite way of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that of the Law. <hi>It is of Faith</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>that it might be by Grace;</hi> the way of Grace is the way of Faith.</p>
            <p>So that is the third aſſertion, with its explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and proof. The fourth Aſſertion is this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That every man in the World hath broken the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. For all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God. The <hi>Jews</hi> call the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> by this Name, The ſinners of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or of the Nations: But what ſaith the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom himſelf was one? <hi>What then? Are we better then they? No, in no wiſe:</hi> For we have before proved both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they are all under ſin, as it is written, <hi>There is none righteous, no not one,</hi> v. 9, 10. When the <hi>Jews</hi> brought a Woman taken in Adultery, unto our Saviour, to ſee what Judgement he would paſs upon her, he delivered the Woman by this ſentence of ſtoning her, <hi>Let him that hath no ſin, caſt the firſt ſtone at her:</hi> Now if there had then been but one there that durſt pretend to have been without ſin, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might perhaps have loſt her life, <hi>John</hi> 8.34.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64817:26"/>And we find it amongſt our ſelves, none but ſome brain-ſick people dare pretend to be free from ſin; even actual ſin, committed in their own perſon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>deed, word,</hi> or <hi>thought</hi> at leaſt. Now if we have all thus offended the law, and tranſgreſſed the law, ſhall we dare appeal unto it, or can it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us?</p>
            <p>The fifth aſſertion therefore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which determines the Queſtion negatively, is, That the law is diſabled from juſtifying us, by reaſon of ſin: In <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. Juſtification is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that impoſſibility of the lavv, tranſlated thus, <hi>What the Law could not do;</hi> the lavv novv cannot do it, according to that famous aſſertion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to this very purpoſe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>For if there had been a Law given which could have given life, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law:</hi> The Iavv cannot novv juſtifie, and vvhat is the reaſon? Why the Apoſtle tells us in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>What the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh:</hi> The law became thus diſabled in the matter of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation through the fleſh, through <hi>ſinful fleſh,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the following words; ſo that now it could not juſtifie us if it would never ſo fain.</p>
            <p>We can conceive no way now that the Lord hath to juſtifie by us the law, but this one; firſt to pardon, then to give us a ſtock of grace &amp; ability to keep his law, as he gave to <hi>Adam;</hi> but then mark, here you ſee, firſt the way of Grace &amp; Faith muſt be made uſe of, before the law can do us any good, or ſtand us in any ſtead: therefore ſtill the fifth aſſertion holds true that the law in the preſent ſtate of things cannot juſtifie us, except the way of grace ſhould firſt paſs upon us, and then what need vve come to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64817:26"/>the lavv again? No, it is ſo true that the lavv can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not novv juſtifie us, nor give life unto us; that if it could have done it, it ſhould have done it, and God would not have made uſe of any other way.</p>
            <p>I might now give ſeveral Scripture-proofs of this aſſertion, under ſeveral Heads: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Law now comes onely the knowledge of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified; for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin.</hi> Where-ever the Law comes now amongſt ſinners, it diſcovers that they are guilty in ſuch, and ſuch a particular; <hi>I had not known ſin</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but by the Law; for I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> Rom. 7.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Law worketh therefore Wrath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot juſtifie; this is the Apoſtles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Now the Law worketh Wrath theſe two ways, either it ſetteth home the Wrath of God already deſerved upon the Conſcience, or it gives occaſion to further ſinning, and ſo to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſert of Wrath; for the Law hath this ſtrange effect now upon a ſinners heart that ſeeks to be juſtified by it, that it will (contrary to the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it which was to ſanctifie, juſtifie, and ſave) it will now ſtir up all manner of luſts in the heart (as the Sun ſhining on a Dunghil ſends forth a ſtink) and ſo not onely diſcovers our former ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demerits and deſerving of Wrath, but provokes to further ſinning, &amp; ſo lays us under more wrath ſtil; if this be not a truth, let any make ſence of theſe Scriptures, if they can, Rom. 7.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Sinta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of Concupiſence, for without the Law ſin was dead; for I was alive without the Law once; but when
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64817:27"/>the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I dyed; and the Commandment which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death; for ſin taking occaſion by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deceived me, and by it ſlew me.</hi> 13. <hi>Was then that which is good, made death unto me? God forbid; but ſin that it might appear ſin, working death in me, by that which is good, that ſin by the Commandment might become out of meaſure ſinful.</hi> I know ſeveral of theſe expreſſions are, and may be in part interpreted of ſin in the guilt, that it appears by the law; but it muſt alſo be underſtood of the power of ſin, that the law diſcovers that likewiſe whileſt it irritates and provokes it; and I would fain know if there can be any other ſence of that whole context from the 1. to the 7. ver of that chap. eſpecially the 5. ver. <hi>When we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſin which were by the Law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The law by both theſe effects diſcovering of ſin, and exciting ſin, as alſo ſhewing the Wrath due to ſin is ſo far from juſtifying, that it becomes the Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation to the ſinner, and not of juſtification unto life; and for this we may conſult the whole third Chap. of the ſecond to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My 6th. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Aſſertion therefore is this, Faith is the way, and the onely way that we have to take for Juſtification being ſinners; We muſt have Mercy, Grace, Pardon; We muſt not think to ſtand upon our terms, to require Juſtification as a due debt; We muſt be glad to receive it as a gift, and this is the way that Faith leads us in: That Faith and Grace are one way, I have proved before, in reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning up the ſeveral Synonymaes of thoſe onely two wayes which the Apoſtle mentions. Now that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64817:27"/>Faith is the onely way for us, appears from what hath been already ſaid and proved: For if the law be no way, and there be only theſe two wayes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, then there is no other way but this of Faith left us: But I ſhall yet give one full Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof of this, Rom. 3.21. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fieſh be juſtified in his ſight; but now the righteouſneſs of God without the Law is manifeſted—even the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> 24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace.</hi> 28. <hi>Therefore we conclude, That a man is juſtified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 7th. and laſt Propoſition is this, That <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> there hath been no other way of Juſtification which hath taken effect upon any ſinful man, nor any other way adhered to by any of the true Saints of God ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> but this way of Faith. And the Apoſtle takes this way of proof, <hi>viz</hi> from the event: For moſt people are more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Events, then with Arguments from the nature and profound reaſon of the thing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having proved it firſt from the nature of the law, I come to examples, and they ſhall be but two, one plain, the other myſtical; and laſtly, prove it from a Teſtimony out of <hi>David</hi> to this way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith; herein following the Apoſtle in the way which he takes, or rather herein onely marking out the way which he takes, not imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in doing the like.</p>
            <p>The firſt and onely-plain example which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle proves Juſtification by Faith by, is that of <hi>Abraham;</hi> this example of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Apoſtle hath continual recourſe to, in his Diſcourſes of this ſubject, both in the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> and well might, having to deal with the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Jewd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>izing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64817:28"/>Gentiles,</hi> who gloryed in nothing more, then to be called and accounted <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in his urging this Example, plainly proceeds upon ſuch a ſuppoſition as this, <hi>Certainly your Father Abraham was juſtified in the right way, and you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be juſtified in no other way then he was:</hi> Now He prove to you clearly, that he was not juſtified by the law, nor by vvorks, but by Faith, &amp; by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; therefore juſtification is not by the lavv, nor by vvorks, but by Faith. Thus the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, that Abraham our Father, as pertaining to the fleſh hath found?</hi> That is, either <hi>Abraham</hi> our fleſhly Father hath found, or <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father hath found ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, that is, in the vvay of a fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteouſneſs: VVhat hath he found? Hath he found Juſtification by the fleſh? Shall vve ſay he hath? It follovvs ver. 2. <hi>For if Abrahaw were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God;</hi> that is, but he hath not vvhereof to glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, therefore he vvas not juſtified by vvorks: For if he vvere juſtified by vvorks, he might glory before God; for the lavv of vvorks, if a man hath theſe vvorks, doth not exclude glorying before God: But novv <hi>Abraham</hi> hath not vvhereof to glory before God, therefore he vvas not juſtified by works, <hi>v.</hi> 3. For what ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham believed God, and it was counted to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, v.</hi> 4, 5. Now he that believeth, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> did, he worketh not, that is, ſeeks not Juſtification by works. Novv ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. vvhere the ſame example is brought in proof by the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs, v.</hi> 7. Knovv there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64817:28"/>that they which are of Faith, and for the way of believing, the ſame are the true Children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and the onely bleſſed or juſtified perſons, v. 18. For if the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of the Promiſe; but God gave it to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> by Promiſe, therefore he had not the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance by the Law, nor the Works of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt not expect it that way, for we muſt bejuſtified the ſame way that <hi>Abraham</hi> was. Having given you the plain example, I ſhal likewiſe give you the Myſtical or Allegorical example which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle produceth to prove this laſt aſſertion, that <hi>de facto,</hi> Faith hath been all along the way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; and it is ſafe uſing Allegories when the truth is once well eſtabliſhed; and I have heard it obſerved, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were much taken with this way of Allegories: The Allegorical example therefore is that of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Saraah,
<note place="margin">The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi>
                  </note> Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. from the 21. <hi>ver.</hi> to the end. The ſubſtance of it is this; <hi>Hagar</hi> was Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia;</hi> and that Mountain vvhich the <hi>Jews</hi> call <hi>Sinai,</hi> the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Hagar:</hi> Novv upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> or Mount <hi>Hagar,</hi> vvas the Lavv delivered, as much as to ſay, Allegorically: <hi>Hagar</hi> and her Seed are for Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for the Lavv, and the Works of it, for juſtification: But novv <hi>Sarah</hi> anſvvers <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above, and to <hi>Mount Sion;</hi> that is, ſhe vvas a Type of the Goſpel-Church, vvhich is for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith. Novv vvhat ſaith the Scripture (<hi>v:</hi> 30.) concerning theſe tvvo Mothers and their Children, vvhich was not onely true literally, but is to be underſtood myſtically and figuratively of the two Seeds, of thoſe two ſorts of men that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, the one to the Law for juſtification, the other to the way of believing; what ſaith the Scripture?

               <hi>Caſt out the Bond-woman and her ſon, for the ſon of the Bond-woman ſhall not be heir with the Son of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman;</hi> as much as to ſay, Thoſe that go to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> to the Law for Juſtification, ſhall never be heirs of God, but only the Goſpel-Churcch, thoſe that adhere to the way of Juſtification by Faith, according to that Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance be of the Law, it is no more of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but God gave it to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and her Seed by promiſe. <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Father of us all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. and <hi>Saraah,</hi> vvhich anſvvers to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> that is above, is the Mother of us all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. Novv if any ſhould object, that this prove; <hi>de facto</hi> onely ſince <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, for all that vvould be accounted of his Seed: I anſvver.

It follows <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin:</hi> Here <hi>David</hi> makes him the onely bleſſed man
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64817:29"/>that is juſtified by Faith; and what is this Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion other then pardon of ſin, forgiveneſs of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Mercy, Grace, a thing that the Law is not acquainted with; the Law cannot juſtifie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, as Faith can, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. How Faith receives pardon, and what this Faith is, I ſhall have beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to diſcover in the following part of this Diſcourſe; in the mean time I reckon that I have eſtabliſhed theſe two poſitions in the general, that the Law is now no way of Juſtification; and that Faith which is the way of Grace and Pardon, is the only way left us, which ſufficiently appears from Reaſon and Example; the Reaſon is that of the fall and ſinfulneſs of mankind: The Example is that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which may ſerve inſtead of all, and that which is of kin to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Allegory of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> together with all the Saints of the Old-Teſtament, reckoned up in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>To which as an overplus, I may adde the reaſon of God's approbation of this way of believing, and preferring this way before the reviving the old way of Works again: And this we have <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.
<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why after there was once a neceſſity of pardon, the Lord was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the way of grace alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace.</hi> When once man had fallen, and ſo brought on a neceſſity of another way of Salvation, (if the Lord wouldſhew ſo much mercy) when once the way of Grace became neceſſary, the Great God liked this way of Grace altogether; not to pardon man, and then ſet him up a new in the way of Works; and the Lord liked the continuation of the way of Grace, rather then re-introducing the old way, that hereby he might have a great revenue of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from his Grace, which would be ſhown in this way; the Lord liked not ſo well that his Creature
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64817:30"/>ſhould come, and (as it were) challenge his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation as a Debt, which in the way of the Law he might have done; <hi>To him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reward is not reckoned of Grace, but of Debt:</hi> The Lord liked not that the Creature ſhould glory and boaſt that it had ſaved it ſelf, as in the way of Works it might have done; for glorying is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Law of Works, but onely by the Law of Faith; whereas this way of Grace excludes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, and that indebtedneſs of God to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and holds the Creature in continual debt and obligation to God: When <hi>Paul</hi> would have had the Thorn in the fleſh, the Meſſenger of <hi>Satan</hi> taken off from buffeting him, the Lord teacheth <hi>Paul</hi> to be contented with this anſwer, <hi>My Grace is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 12 7, 8, 9. This way of believing taught <hi>Paul</hi> to depend upon the Grace and Strength of God, by which the Lord received an Honour which he ſhould not have had if the temptation had been ſuddenly taken off. And this we find to be the great Reaſon alledged by the Apoſtle frequently in this ſubject: God in the way of his Goſpel-Grace, goes quite croſs to that way which man would have choſen, for this very reaſon, to hinder man's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and boaſting; ſo we have it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.28, 29. <hi>The baſe things of the World, and things which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, hath God choſen to bring to nought the things that are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence:</hi> And in the 30.31. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Redemption, that according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord:</hi> So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. when the Apoſtle had ſhewed what God had declared to be his Righteouſneſs, even that of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64817:30"/>Faith, <hi>Where is glorying then,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle? It is excluded. Again, the righteouſneſs of the Law and Works, is called <hi>our own righteouſneſs;</hi> but Faith is called <hi>the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Rom. 3.22 Now God will not allow that we ſhould be juſtified by our own righteouſneſs, he will have another righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is not our own, that we may glory in him alone.</p>
            <p>Having aſſerted and proved thoſe two Poſitions, <hi>That the Law is no way,</hi> and <hi>that Faith is the onely way of Juſtification:</hi> I come now to anſwer the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that may be made againſt what I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, either in behalf of the Law, or againſt the way of believing.</p>
            <p>The great objection (and that which contains almoſt all that can be mentioned) is ſtarted by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19.
<note place="margin">Object. <hi>Wherefore then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the law.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Wherefore then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Law? is the Law of no uſe then, as you ſeem to make it? For if it were once a way of life, as you acknowledge, and the Scripture affirms it was ordained to be unto life,</hi> Rom. 7.10. <hi>and it be now no way unto life, but the way of Faith onely is, then you make it an old antiquated thing out of date, out of uſe. And the Apoſtle is ſenſible that this inconvenience would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, Rom.</hi> 3.31. Do we then make void the Law through Faith?</p>
            <p>But the meaning of the objection in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. is chiefly this, <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the Law;</hi> that is, To what end or purpoſe was the Law given to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes?</hi> You aſſert, ſay the objectors, that as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> fell, the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of no uſe to him, nor any of his poſterity, in the matter of Juſtification; but yet we find that the Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> 2000. years after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's</hi> fall, and it was given in the moſt glorious
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64817:31"/>manner, with the moſt aſtoniſhing glory that ever God appeared in, at any time unto the World; it was delivered by Angels, with the voice of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, with Thundering, and Lightning, and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, ſo that the whole Mountain was of a fire; and all the people ſaw and heard the thunder and fire, and the voice of Words: Yea God himſelf is ſaid to deſcend upon the Mount in fire, and ſpeak with <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 4.17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 18.19, 20, 21. And ſay the Objectors, <hi>Whereas you ſeem to ſay in your third Poſition, That the Law was onely a way of Juſtification to Adam:</hi> The Scripture makes no mention that ever the Law was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> but onely to the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and when ever you have a compariſon made between the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace, or betwixt the Lavv and Faith, it is the comparing ſtill of the Covenant vvith the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Old-Teſtament, and the Nevv-Covenant mad by Chriſt vvith his people under the Goſpel: So vve ſind theſe two ways compared in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the chap. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. throughout that chapter; but eſpecially from <hi>v.</hi> 6. to the end; In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. there the Law is indeed called a Miniſtration of death, but yet it is the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> for in the ſame ver. it is ſaid to be written &amp; engraven in ſtones, which is plainly the Law of the ten Commandments; and that when <hi>Moſes</hi> brought them to the people, his countenance had ſuch a glory and luſtre upon it, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his face, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. And this Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Old-Teſtament, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. And this is that which is compared with the Goſpel which <hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>ver,</hi> 12.13. <hi>Seeing that we have ſuch hope, we uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech, and not as Moſes, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64817:31"/>put a vail over his face, &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> The Law reacht fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the days of <hi>Adam</hi> for a way of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it was given to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and it was their Covenant or Teſtament; and if it be done away, it was not till the dayes of the Goſpel by Chriſt, according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>The</hi> Law <hi>was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but</hi> Grace <hi>came by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 23. <hi>Before</hi> Faith <hi>came, we were kept under the</hi> Law, <hi>ſhut up unto the</hi> Faith which ſhould afterwards be revealed. So in <hi>Heb</hi> 8.6. ſpeaking of Chriſt; <hi>But now hath he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a more excellent Miniſtry, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>For if that firſt Covenant had been faultleſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond; but finding fault, he ſaith, Behold the dayes come ſaith the Lord, when</hi> I <hi>will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and with the Houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>not according to the Covenant that</hi> I <hi>made with their Fathers, when</hi> I <hi>brought them out of the Land of Aegypt.</hi> And what Covenant was that I pray, but the Law, the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> ver. 13. <hi>In that he ſaith a New Covenant, he hath made the firſt old; now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> From this whole context I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, ſayes the objector, That the Law, which is famouſly known to be the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant till Chriſts time at leaſt, with the people of of God, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> and ſo a way of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which is quite contrary to your fifth and ſeventh Poſitions; or elſe ſhew of what uſe the Law was, when given to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this of being a way of Juſtification, or a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, which is all one. Wherefore then ſerveth the Law? Is it of no uſe now unto us?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64817:32"/>Or rather, wherfore then was it given to the <hi>Jews?</hi> Was it of no uſe to them? Was it not their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? And therefore muſt it not be their way of Juſtification? Elſe ſhew how it would deſerve the Name of the firſt, or old Covenant or Teſtament?</p>
            <p>Nay, to adde a little more matter of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, the Law hath the Language of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a condition annexed, and that when it was given to the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and the Lord tells his people, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. after the delivery of the Law, <hi>That if a man do theſe things, he ſhall live;</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.10. in thoſe words of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> to deſcribe a legal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in oppoſition to the Righteouſneſs of Faith; <hi>For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs of the Law, that the man which doth thoſe things, ſhall live by them; but the righteouſneſs which is of Faith, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethon this wiſe</hi>—that is, in an oppoſite manner: Therefore certainly ſaith the objection, the Law when it was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was given as a way of Juſtification: Nay our Saviour himſelf ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.28. ſpeaking of the law of <hi>Moſes, This do, and thou ſhalt live:</hi> Therefore certainly the law is a way, if not the onely way of Juſtification un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fallen man; for thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> then were fallen, as well as we are now.</p>
            <p>This is the objection, which is indeed weighty and conſiderable, and of purpoſe rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Apoſtle, in the firſt great branch of it, that it might receive an anſwer: It conſiſts of ſeveral branches, to all which I ſhall endeavour to apply an anſwer in its place; and firſt I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with that part which is greateſt, which when well anſwered, the reſt will receive an eaſie ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it is this: <hi>For what ends or purpoſes was the Law given to the Children of Iſrael, if not for a way of Juſtification?</hi> Now as I gave the objection firſt in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64817:32"/>the Apoſtles words, ſo I ſhall give you the anſwer to it in his words in that ſame Chap. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. This great objection therefore the Apoſtle anſwers in the ſame way that our Saviour ſometimes anſwered the cavilling Phariſees with a queſtion all as hard, or harder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A:</hi> You come, ſaith the Apoſtle, in a cavilling way againſt the Doctrine of Faith which we preach, and tell me, the law hath been a way, and therefore is a way, and the way of Juſtification; and you tell me it was not onely a way to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, but to all the people of God, before that Jeſus, and we his Apoſtles preached up this way of believing: And you go to prove this laſt thing that you ſay, that it was the way to all the Saints of God till Chriſt's time (which is the great thing that I deny) by a meer cavil; Forſooth <hi>elſe wherefore doth it ſerve? Of what uſe elſe is it?</hi> And I anſwer: you with an harder queſtion by far? <hi>Wherefore then ſereth the promiſe? To what end ſerve the promiſes? To what end ſerves the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that was preached to Abraham?</hi> Gal. 3.8. The Scriptute foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through Faith preached before the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. You ask, <hi>To what end ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Law then?</hi> And I ask, To what end ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Goſpel then, that was preached to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> before the law was given?

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Seed 430. years before ever the law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ver. 17. Shall I ever be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe, that when God had ſet up a way of Grace, nay had eſtabliſhed &amp; confirmed it in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, not to <hi>Adam</hi> only, who was a remote Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, nay
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64817:33"/>had confirmed it in Chriſt; ſhall I think that the law coming by <hi>Moſes</hi> 430 years after, ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annul this Covenant, and make the promiſe of none effect? What did God repent of his being ſo gracious, and ſet up a way that had no Grace, and can have no Grace in it? or was not the great God obliged to make good his Promiſe and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Why, if it be but a mans covenant, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is confirmed, no man diſannulleth or addeth thereto. Now this was Gods Covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 15, 16, 17, 18. that is, This is the full ſcope and genius of his Diſcourſe; Finding thus a Covenant made and confirmed ſo long before, I wil never believe, it can never be, that the law coming ſo long after, ſhould come in to put an end to it, to make the way of Juſtification by Faith to ceaſe; What ever therefore the law came for, this could never be the end of it.</p>
            <p>And here the Apoſtle might have ended the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, having ſilenced the queſtion by a greater: <hi>For it is as certain, (if not more) that God cannot fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">There were other ends of giving the Law, beſides juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the works of it.</note> beſides Juſtification by the works of it; For the Apoſtle wil readily allow that there were great and weighty ends of the delivery of the law, that it was delivered with great Majeſty and Authority, that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and juſt, and good: The Apoſtle never ſpeaks light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the law; no you ſhall find, ſaith the Apoſtle, that by the preaching of Faith <hi>we go</hi> the higheſt way in the World <hi>to eſtabliſh the Laws</hi> Rom. 3.31.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64817:33"/>We will allow any thing that can be thought or imagined for the honour of the law, if you will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate us thus much, that it is not a way of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I come therefore to ſhew ſome other ends of the law's being given (which were indeed very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable) beſides that of its being a way of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the works of it.</p>

The truth is therefore this ſeems to be the plain reaſon of the Law's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added with reſpect to tranſgreſſions. Before the Law and the Scriptures written by <hi>Moſes,</hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64817:35"/>ſhould be taught, but that they would be apt to break out into manifold tranſgreſſions, except they had the Law written plainly for them in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone, ſo that every man might teach his Neighbour, when they grew irregular and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaying, <hi>Know the Lord;</hi> then, for the ſake of theſe tranſgreſſions, and for the prevention of them the Law was added. So you ſee the Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> onely occaſionally.

            <p>This is the ſubſtance of the anſwer, and to this ſuits exceeding wel another place of the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.7, 8, 9.

(where he is ſpeaking of the Gentiles) yet men will not be at the pains to read or ſtudy what is written there, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would <hi>Iſrael</hi> have done it, had not the Law been written for them in Tables of ſtone too; they would not have known God's Judgements any more then other Nations, had not God given his Law to them by <hi>Moſes:</hi> And this we ſee by the event; for that, notwithſtanding this Law, yet when they came amongſt other Nations, they ran into their abominations, though they had expreſs Laws againſt them; what would they have done therefore if they had been wholly without this Law? There was therefore a neceſſity, at leaſt a great requiſitneſs of a Law to be given to <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64817:36"/>if God loved them, and would manifeſt his love to them more then to any other people; he could not do it in an higher inſtance, then in giving them the Law. Therefore you ſee the Law might be given for other reaſons then this, to be a way of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the works of it, I will ſhew further anon why the lavv vvas given with reſpect to tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I ſhall onely in the mean time obſerve one or tvvo things further in the Apoſtles anſwer to the objection, which I mentioned by the Name of cautionary circumſtances in his Anſwer; one is this, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, it was added, <hi>non data ſed addita eſt;</hi> it is not ſaid ſimply, <hi>the Law was given,</hi> but <hi>added becauſe of tranſgreſſions;</hi> Added to what? Why to the Promiſes, to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that vvas on foot before, long before; above 2000. years before, in <hi>Adam</hi>'s time; 430. years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in <hi>Abraham's</hi> time; it vvas added to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that vvas before confirmed of God in Chriſt; and it vvas added, not as a ſupplement, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel vvas compleat in it ſelf; it ſaved thouſands before ever the Lavv vvas given by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and it vvould have ſaved thouſands more, and might have ſerved till the coming of Chriſt, for all any abſolute neceſſity that there vvas of it. Onely if the Lord vvould be ſo gracious to his people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> above all Nations in the World, to give them his Will in Writing at large, that they might be the better contained in their obedience, better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations vvere; This vvas the Lords Bounty and Grace to them; but it is certain, 'tvvas never given them to be ſo much as a neceſſary ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Goſpel that vvas before, in the matter of Juſtification: It vvas added onely occaſionally, as an uſeful Appendix, not as a neceſſary ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64817:37"/>not vvith deſign to ſupplant, but to ſerve the Goſpel. I have mentioned one of the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or cautionary circumſtances vvhich the Apoſtle uſeth in his aſſigning the reaſon of the Lavv's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given;
<note place="margin">As the law was given onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, ſo it was but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</note> it vvas added, there is another, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> until ſuch time as the Seed ſhould come. As the Law was but occaſionally and additionally given at firſt; ſo it is but temporary in its continuance; as there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in its beginning; ſo there is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſet-time of its continuance: Here obſerve, that though the Apoſtle doth allow that there was a weighty reaſon, a great occaſion of the Law's being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet he is afraid at the ſame time, leſt the Law ſhould get too much advantage by this allowance of his, and therefore gives theſe ſeveral terms of diminution, whileſt he ſpeaks moſt for the honor of the Law. Let us return now a little more to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the myſtery that is contain'd in that phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Law was added, becauſe of Tranſgreſſions; for you ſhall find that there is much of myſtery in it yet, beſides what I have mentioned; What I have mentioned, lyes more obvious; that which remains is much more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and myſterious, yet expreſly aſſerted by the Apoſtle in ſeveral places. The Law therefore was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion in theſe three reſpects.
<note place="margin">The Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note> 1. To hinder tranſgreſſion from being committed. 2. To aggravate tranſgreſſions that were or ſhould be committed. And 3. ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to finiſh tranſgreſſions, and make an end of ſin by driving and directing the wounded ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to a Saviour. And all thoſe three reaſons are as I may ſay, fundamental in the occaſion of the Law its being added to the promiſes, till the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64817:37"/>time that the Seed ſhould come. 1. The Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions, that is, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tranſgreſſions from being committed; and the Law was added to hinder tranſgreſſions theſe two ways. 1. As a large plain Rule to ſhew them what was their duty, that ſo they might not run into tranſgreſſions through ignorance: And 2dly, as a fiery Law to deter them from ſin, and frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them into their duty, that ſo they might not run into tranſgreſſions through negligence. 1. As a large plain Rule to ſhew them their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This particular, and this onely I inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ere-while, when I explained what was the ſubſtance of the Apoſtles Anſwer to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I ſhall add no more unto it.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, It did not onely hinder tranſgreſſion by informing them in their duty leſt they ſhould run into tranſgreſſion through ignorance; but as a fiery Law to deter them from tranſgreſſion, and to frighten them into their duty, that they might not tranſgreſs through negligence; though this doth not ſo much refer to the matter of the Law, as to the manner of its delivery. But yet this manner of its delivery is as much taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the Apoſtle, and was as neceſſary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as the matter of the Law it ſelf. Now this manner of its delivery with dread and terror, conſiſts of two things: 1.
<note place="margin">Wherein conſiſts the terror of the Law.</note> That it was delivered with thunderings and lightnings, &amp;c. 2. That it was delivered much in the form of a Covenant of Works, without that mixture of promiſes which the Goſpel abounds with; and theſe two things make up the terror of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and indeed this terror made up of theſe two parts, is almoſt all that which is peculiar to their

               </gap>, that the Law entered; the Law hunted it, followed it, ſtole in afterwards to diſcover ſin; for as <hi>ver.</hi> 13. hath it, <hi>Before,</hi> or <hi>until the Law, ſin was in the world;</hi> that is, not before the Law did oblige, but before the Law was delivered in ſuch a ſolemn manner as it was upon <hi>Mount Sinai;</hi> before the Law ſin was in the world; but ſin was not imputed when there was no Law; yet death reigned all this while till <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, which was the curſe of the Law. Now that men might know wherefore they ſuffered death, and the curſe, it was ſit the Law ſhould come into the world in a ſolemn manner delivered, that ſo ſin might be imputed by men to themſelves, as it was by God to men, witneſs death, the curſe of the Law, which reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes;</hi> from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> that ſinned, to <hi>Moſes</hi> that gave the Law; ſin did not appear to be ſin, till the Law entred; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>Sin that it might appear ſin, working death in me by that which is good,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Law) <hi>that ſin by the Commandment might become out of meaſure ſinfull.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20 the Apoſtle proves that the Law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtifie; for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin. The Law is ſo far from juſtifying (ſaith the Apoſtle) that it only brings ſin to light, brings the knowledg of ſin with it, makes the offence to abound; and if that be the way to juſtifie ſinners, to aggravate their ſins, &amp; bind on their guilts more then ever u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their conſciences, let any man judg; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeed the Law in the immediate great intent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64817:40"/>of it was a killing Letter, an Adminiſtration of Death, a Miniſtration of Condemnation, a Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Deſperation, and not of righteouſneſs unto juſtification; and accordingly it was delivered with thundering &amp; lightning upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> to ſhew the horrible fire, darkneſs &amp; tempeſt that there was in the Law it ſelf, to all that ſhould come near it, to think to make uſe of it for a way of Juſtification; as <hi>Moſes</hi> put a Vail upon his face to ſhew the vailed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Diſpenſation, ſo the Law was delivered with fire, to ſhew the fierineſs of the Law unto the conſcience; for the Law was not only terrible to the beholders of it, when it was given upon Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai;</hi> but this terribleneſs is in the Law it ſelf, to all that ever had to do with it, feelingly ever ſince, to all that ever came near it for juſtification. Indeed for thoſe that ſtand aloof off from it, only play a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it at a diſtance, &amp; hope to be ſaved in a looſe way by their works, by their good doings, and by their good meanings, they may perhaps never feel the ſtinging fiery laſhes of the Law; but let any of theſe ſelf-Juſticiaries drive their Principle to an Head, let them come up near to the Law, let them advance toward Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and approach it, and challenge their Juſtification from God by the Law, and they ſhall quickly find themſelvs ſcorched and ſcalded, &amp; ſent away with ſad hearts and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conſciences; they'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ded</note> I haſten to the third great end of the Law's being added with reſpect to tranſgreſſions, and that was for the finiſhing of tranſgreſſions, and making an end of ſin as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are, though ſomewhat otherwiſe uſed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. What ſhall we think, that when God had given promiſes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and confirmed a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in Chriſt to him and his Seed, that he now gave a law to drive all his people into deſpair? this amounts all to one, as if he had broken his promiſe and his covenant, as I have before argued out of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> did the Lord only ſend his law that they might know their duty, and be affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into their duty, as the firſt particular carries it? &amp; if they did not do their duty, ſhould the law ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their ſin, &amp; bind on their guilts upon their Conſcience, and ſo leave them under deſparation, and be a miniſtration of death to them? Was this all the Law came for? If this were all, they might better have been without the law at a venture, then have had it; they might have done better with the promiſes alone: This therefore was not all the end of the Law, to bring them into deſperation, and there to leave them; but by this deſperation, which indeed the Law was to bring them into, to make them hunger and thirſt after another righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then that of the law, which by the law they might ſee they could not have, to make them in love with the promiſes, with any thing that looks like mercy and grace, and in a word to direct them and drive them to Chriſt and a Goſpel-Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. The law was our School-maſter to bring us to Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. The Scripture (that is the Law) hath
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64817:41"/>concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, might be given to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. 23. <hi>Before Faith came, we were kept under the Law,</hi> included as priſoners, <hi>ſhut up unto the Faith which ſhould afterwards be revealed.</hi> Rom. 10.3. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs, unto every one that believeth.</hi> So that indeed the Law was given, not to undermine the promiſe, but to ſerve the ends and honour of the promiſe. The law entred not to preach a Legal Juſtification, but an Evangelical. The Law came into the world to confeſs its own impotency to ſave or juſtifie us, as alſo to ſend and direct us to one that could, according to that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.21.22: <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight; for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin: But now the righteouſneſs of God without the Law is manifeſted, being witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteouſneſs of God which is by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe.</hi> The righteouſneſs of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law is witneſſed by the law: There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures to this purpoſe, which I forbear to mention. Thus the Law and the Goſpel do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good turns for one another; the Law prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the Goſpel moſt effectually; for men never well cloſe with the Goſpel, till they feel the laſh of the Law: And the Goſpel again moſt effectually eſtabliſheth and obligeth to the keeping of the Law; for till men have a principle of faith, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a living principle of obedience; thus the elder, which is the Law, is made to ſerve the younger, that is, the Goſpel; but the Goſpel hath an ingenuity in it, to return the Law a due acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64817:41"/>And the Law might well direct the ſinner to Chriſt, and preach Juſtification by Faith; for this was the onely way of recovering its own honour and obedience, which was due unto it,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Why the Law might well direct to Chriſt.</note> as appears in theſe three particulars. Firſt, for that Chriſt perſonally fulfilled it to a tittle; he lived a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect life, and performed unerring obedience for more then thirty years together, here amongſt men upon earth; and this is ſaid by ſome Divines to be for the Juſtification of his own perſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and is known by the name of his active obedience. 2. For thoſe whom he was to ſave and redeem from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, from under the puniſhments and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties which were due to them for the breaches of it; he underwent all that the law exacted from him as their Mediator, till the law was fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As for the perſons themſelves thus redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſufferings of an innocent and legally-righteous Saviour; they are not owned by this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be his redeemed ones any further, then as they acknowledg the perfect holineſs of the law, &amp; that they themſelves are obliged as Creatures, and the redeemed ones of Chriſt, to endeavour to their utmoſt to keep the law ſtill to a tittle, and do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform a ſincere obedience to it, not diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with themſelves in any command of it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing their infirmities wherein they fall ſhort of unerring obedience; ſo that in the way of faith, the law obtains its true end, though not exactly in the perſons juſtified, yet in their Saviour; Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom,</hi> 10.4. Yea, and in their perſons thus far, that they perform a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience, and endeavour an unerring obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the law; and thus the righteouſneſs of the law is ſaid to be fuifilled in them, in as much as they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64817:42"/>walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 4.</p>
            <p>So that now I have anſwered the great objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Juſtification by Faith, which was th s, <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the Law?</hi> and that with ſome advantage to the preſent cauſe; I have ſhewn, that whatever the law was intended for in its delivery, it was not given for a way of Juſtification, becauſe the way of faith was eſtabliſht before; the reaſons of its delivery were theſe: 1. It was given to the Jews in mercy, to ſhew them their duty more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they could otherwiſe have known it by the light of nature, or any other way of teaching which they had amongſt them till that time, that ſo they might not run into tranſgreſſions through ignorance, and it was given with terror, that they might not ruſh into tranſgreſſions through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and theſe two particulars made up the firſt end of the delivery of the law, <hi>viz.</hi> to hinder tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions from being committed. 2. It was added to heighten tranſgreſſions in the guilt of them, when they ſhould be committed. 3. Not to leave them in deſparation, but to direct them unto Chriſt; and I have ſhewn that great advantage did accrue to the law this way, that hereby it came to paſs, that though it was not fulfilled by the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in the firſt giving of it, yet it was all as well fulfilled by the ſecond, and every way recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſatisfied as if it had never been broken; ſo that I reckon the Objection is quite taken off, and may be retorted upon the objectors, thus: If they ask, Wherefore then ſerveth the Law? We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It ſerveth to lead men unto Chriſt, that they may be juſtified by Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64817:42"/>I have ſome things yet to add upon the two laſt laſt ends of the law's being given, which I thought not fit to inſert in the firſt mention of them; upon the ſecond end of the law's being given, <hi>viz.</hi> for the aggravating of tranſgreſſion, and loading the Conſcience with guilt, I have this to add. It is ſo true that the law was given to the Jews to make the offence to abound, and to preſs the conſcience with guilt, that it had the ſame effect upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile World to whom it was not delivered as it was unto the Jews; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom</hi> 3. where, when he had recited out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> a Catalogue of ſins which the law doth condemn men for, from the 10. to the 19. ver. in that 19. ver. <hi>Now we know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that whatſoever things the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law, that every mouth may be ſtopped and the whole world might be guilty before God.</hi> Certainly the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are a part, and the greateſt part of the world; now the whole World becomes guilty before God by the law, and every mouth is ſilenced and ſtopped by it. I do not ſay that the law as given to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> had this effect upon the Gentiles, to whom it was not given; but the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. how this came to paſs, that the law, though not given to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in the ſame manner as it was to the Jews, did yet convince and condemn the Gentiles as well as the Jews, becauſe the effect and ſubſtance of the ſame law that was written upon Tables of Stone by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was written in the hearts of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; ſo that their thoughts did accuſe them when they did evil, as well as excuſe them when they did well.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64817:43"/>And the beauty &amp; great conveniency of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of theſe two Adminiſtrations of the Law &amp; Goſpel each to other, appears ſtill in the great work of Converſion upon every ſinners heart, where the ſame method is obſerved: firſt to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſoul by legal convictions, then to make a diſcovery of Chriſt &amp; the Grace of the Goſpel. And this our practical Divines inſiſt much upon in their Sermons and Treatiſes, giving us this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Work of Grace upon the heart, that firſt there is conviction, compunction and humiliation, all yet a legal work; then Faith or Converſion. And I do verily believe, that the Spirit of God doth uſe this method (though as all acknowledge, not with the ſame degrees) in every work of Regeneration. And again they obſerve, that as after the Goſpel and Faith is come, it is abſurd to return to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the whole Diſpenſation of it; ſo they apply that Scripture <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear,</hi> to this purpoſe; That after men have received the Spirit of Adoption, (which in ſome degree every regenerate perſon hath received) they receive not again the ſpirit of bondage to fear; which they take to be a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of legal convictions, preparatory to the Work of Converſion; and indeed (according to the <hi>Calviniſt</hi>-principles) it muſt needs be true, that after they are regenerate, they can never receive a ſpirit of Bondage again, becauſe a ſpirit of bondage is not Grace, but onely preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it; and therefore men that have once been regenerate, can never return to this Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being emptied of all Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64817:44"/>But here it may be further queryed,
<note place="margin">Q How did the Law direct thoſe to Chriſt that lived and lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt came?</note> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not to be doubted that the Law in the diſpenſation of it, made excellent way unto the Goſpel; for thoſe that were to live in the days of the Goſpel; as we find in the Analogical ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Law and Goſpel in the Work of Grace; but how was the Law a School-Maſter unto Chriſt to thoſe that lived in the dayes of the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Who dyed before Chriſt came? How were they directed to Chriſt by the Law? The Law might perhaps be a Miniſtration of death, and deſperation only to them: How did the Law witneſs the righteouſneſs of God by Faith unto them? In anſwer I ſhall firſt of all premiſe theſe two things and then anſwer more directly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, that to theſe it muſt not come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the promiſe and the covenant that was made before, nor the comfort of it. It muſt not come to hinder, but they might have as true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving comfort from the promiſes, as the Saints before the Law had; or elſe the Law had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the promiſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which the Apoſtle denyes with a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. 2. It muſt preach Chriſt to them as truly, though perhaps not ſo clearly as it doth unto us. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly and more directly; The Law did preach Chriſt to the Jews under the Old-Teſtament theſe two ways; 1. Virtually or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially. 2. Formally and expreſly. 1. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, as it convinced them all of their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome other beſides a legal Righteouſneſs, as I have ſhewn at large in explaining the ſecond end of giving the Law, becauſe of tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 2. Expreſly, as it made mention of Chriſt; and this it did either improperly &amp; figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in types and ſhadows, or properly in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and promiſes of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64817:44"/>Or the anſwer may be better given after this diſtinction of the Law.
<note place="margin">A differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Law in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> The Law in Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the various ſignifications of it, hath theſe two very eminent. 1. It ſignifies the ſtrict and bare command, and ſo is naturally a Covenant of Works that hath no mercy or grace in it, can onely juſtifie the righteous, and condemn the tranſgreſſor; and in this ſence it hath been taken by me (for the moſt part) hitherto in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; &amp; I have produced ſeveral places where it is taken in this ſence in the Scripture. Take that for inſtance, <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curſe, as it is written, Curſed is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that continueth not in all things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of the Law, to do them, Gal.</hi> 3.10. 2dly, The Law is taken in a ſence all as large as this is ſtrict; and that is, for the whole Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. So it is likewiſe taken in ſeveral Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Tell me, ye that deſire to be under the Law, do ye not hear the Law? For it is written, that Abraham had two ſons, &amp;c.</hi> where the whole Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is made a part of the Law; again in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. the Apoſtle makes the <hi>Pſalms</hi> a part of the Law, where having quoted a great part of the 14. <hi>Pſalm</hi> in the 19. ver. ſaith he, <hi>Now we know, that whatſoever things the Law ſaith, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo in other Scriptures. Now to apply the diſtinction in anſwer to the laſt query; The Law ſtrictly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Covenant of Works, did only teach Chriſt virtually and by conſequence, as it taught them that they could not be juſtified by its righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; and thus (for ought I know) the Law in its accuſations taught Chriſt to the Gentiles, as it convinced them of the inſufficiency of their own righteouſneſs. But now the Law in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64817:45"/>ſenſe as taken for the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, taught Chriſt formally and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though more obſcurely then the Goſpel tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him, <hi>viz.</hi> in Types and Prophecies; it were endleſs to reckon up all the Types, Promiſes and Propheſies of Chriſt that are in the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: This way indeed the Law could not teach Chriſt unto the Gentiles, who had not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old-Teſtament. It is now high time, and yet in this place ſeaſonable enough, to anſwer ſome other parts of the objection (which I propoſed at large ſome pages ſince) which pleads for the Law its being a way of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the <hi>Jews</hi> at leaſt, before the coming of Chriſt, if not to us now; and ſomething of that which remains yet unanſwered,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. The Law was given to the Iews as their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnant.</note> is this: If the Law was not given to be a way of Juſtification, why is it called a Covenant, the Old-Teſtament or Covenant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. and the firſt Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.8. expreſly ſaid to be made with the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the Lord took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> For whatever you have argued about <hi>Adam</hi>'s eſtate of innocency, that God made a Covenant of Works with him, and that if he would, he might have been juſtified by Works, by the Law; that ſince him all men have ſinned, and the Law was no way of Juſtification to them; Whatever you have argued to this purpoſe, ſay the objectors, yet we find not that the Law was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> but onely to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and given to them as a Covenant, therefore called the old Covenant, or firſt Covenant, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. out of <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32.33, 34. Therefore it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them as a way of Juſtification; for certainly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64817:45"/>the Juſtification that they were to ſeeke of God, they were to ſeek in the way of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, therefore in the way of the Law, which was their Covenant.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer ſome things by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. By way of conceſsion in two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</note> afterwards ſome things more conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: And firſt of all I grant that the Law is no where (to my remembrance) ſaid to be given to <hi>Adam,</hi> but onely to the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> I am ſure uſually when mention is made of the giving of the law,
<note place="margin">Where the law is ſaid to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it is to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> not to <hi>Adam.</hi> Yet <hi>Adam</hi> had the Law, and it was a Covenant of works to him. 1. He had the Law.</note> it is likewiſe noted in the ſame place as given to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>For the Law was given by Moſes, Gal.</hi> 3.19. Wherefore then ſerveth the Law? It was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions—<hi>and it was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Angels upon Mount Sinai,</hi> in the hands of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>viz. Moſes:</hi> Though when I make this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion that the Law is not ſaid to be given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> but to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> I ſtill think it may be eaſily collected from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that <hi>Adam</hi> had the Law too, and that it was to him a Covenant of Works. 1. That he had the Law; for 1. if <hi>Adam</hi> as a creature had not the Law written in his heart, how came the Gentiles, who had not the Law given them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to have it written in their hearts? 2. Elſe as I urged it before, it had been no ſin for man in innocency to have killed whom he pleaſed, to have lyed, forſworn himſelf, to have defiled his own body by Adultery, or other uncleanneſs; <hi>for where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> 3. If <hi>Adam</hi> had not the Law before his fall, how came he to have it written in his heart preſently after? as it is certain he had; for all other men have it ſo written, and I cannot think that <hi>Adam</hi> alone
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64817:46"/>wanted this excellency of all mankind; neither do I think that he got this advantage by his fall, to have the effect of the Law written in his heart, which he had not written there before; therefore he had it written in his heart before the Fall.
<note n="2" place="margin">It was to him a Covenant of works.</note> 2. It was a Covenant of Works to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency. For <hi>Adam</hi> then had no need of Grace or Pardon before his fall; and I have proved that the Law is in its own nature a Covenant of Works; and <hi>Adam</hi> had the Law, therefore it was a Covenant of Works to <hi>Adam;</hi> I deny not but <hi>Adam</hi> might have ſome poſitive Laws in his Covenant of Works, as we find one, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the forbidden fruit.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Conceſſion is this, That the Law was given to the Jews as a Covenant;
<note place="margin">2d. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion.</note> and where-ever mention is made of the Old-Covenant, or Firſt Covenant, the parties covenanted withall, are the people of the Jews: So it is in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.14. in the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> we have mention made of the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is that made by Chriſt in preaching the Goſpel; and in the 14th, of the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Covenant, which is that made with the <hi>Jews:</hi> So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 7. the firſt Covenant is that which <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>Mediator</hi> of; the ſecond or better Covenant is that which Chriſt is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of; this muſt not, cannot be denyed; and I have been often offended at perſons, that when they make a diſtinction of the Covenants, a firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, old and new, they make the firſt, that with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; &amp; the ſecond the Covenant of grace made with the faithful ever ſince; this though it may be true Divinity, yet is not Scriptural; or if it be ſomewhat Scriptural, yet it is onely to be drawn by conſequence out of the Scripture: But there is another determination in this buſineſs that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64817:46"/>is more plainly Scriptural in the words and phraſes of Scripture, which is, that the firſt Covenant, the old Covenant or Teſtament, is God's Covenant with the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes;</hi> the new Covenant is that made with the faithful by Chriſt; and what others aim at in that other way of ſtating the Covenants, may be attained without that confuſion which they make.</p>
            <p>Having made two as fair Conceſſions as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors can deſire,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A.</hi> 2.</note> I come now to the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the queſtion, or repelling the Objection, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have minded you of a diſtinction of the Law, which I lately gave, and it was this, That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Law is taken ſtrictly for the bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, with the threatning annexed to the breach of it, and the promiſe of life upon the ſtrict obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it: So it is in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. ſometimes it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the whole Old-Teſtament, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. where the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> are made a part of the law; ſometimes taken for the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.44. where the Old-Teſtament is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into theſe three parts, The Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets and the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Now I anſwer, Take the Law in the firſt ſence for a Covenant of Works ſtrictly, and ſo it was not given for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the <hi>Jews,</hi> for then it muſt have come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the promiſes, or the Covenant of God in Chriſt that was made before: But take it in the ſecond or third ſenſe, either for the whole Old-Teſtament (as we call the Writings of the holy men of God till our Saviours time) or for the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the diſpenſation by <hi>Moſes</hi> from the Mount; and this I confeſs was a Covenant to them, but then it was a Covenant of Grace, and indeed contained in it all the promiſes that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64817:47"/>before it, <hi>that traditional Gospel which Abraham and the holy Patriarchs before him were ſaved by, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Law of Moſes,</hi> elſe it had been a vain thing for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to have undertaken to prove Juſtification by Faith out of the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea out of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> for, as a man cannot bring a clean thing out of an unclean, ſo neither can he bring Goſpel out of pure Law; if therefore the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had not been a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, the Apoſtle could never have proved Juſtification by faith out of it, which yet he doth not onely by ſtrained conſequences, but as there profeſſedly. <hi>Abraham believed God,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> they therefore which are of Faith, are bleſſed and juſtified with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> Galathians 3. ver. 6, 7, 9. which is as fair an <hi>Enthymema,</hi> as can be, and every Sophiſter can ſupply the Propoſition that is wanting. St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves Juſtification by Faith by two great Arguments out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the firſt Book of <hi>Moſes, viz:</hi> by <hi>Abraham's</hi> Juſtification, and the Allegory of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> which I explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and urged before.</p>
            <p>Nay the Apoſtle makes a great affirmation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which is this that even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf the great Law-Covenant Mediator, doth in his Writings give a clear diſtinction of the two Covenants of Works and Grace, ſhews us the tenour of one Covenant and another; When he had produced the Allegory of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſaith he, Alas, <hi>Moſes</hi> in this Story gives you Allegorically the two Covenants, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 21. to the 24. But the chief place for proof of what I have ſaid, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 6.—<hi>for Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the Law, That the man which doth theſe things, ſhall</hi>

               <hi>But the righteouſneſs which is of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thine heart who ſhall aſcend up into Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo goes on in the words of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 30.12, 13, 14. Here we ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Writings, delineates and deſcribes the two ways of Works and Grace, of the Law and Faith; and it is proved out of the ſame <hi>

                  </gap>oſes,</hi> that the Law is no way to juſtifie ſinners: Now I ſhall but draw out the Apoſtles Argument, which I ſuppoſe to be this: <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes two ways of Juſtification, that by the Law, and that by Faith; that by the Law <hi>Moſes</hi> tells you is no way for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, becauſe you muſt continue in all things, or you are accurſed; therefore certainly he deſcribed the way of Faith too, that ye might betake your ſelves unto it for juſtification and life; therefore the Law, take it either for the whole Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for the Diſpenſation by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and it was a Covenant indeed with the <hi>Jews;</hi> but it was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, for in it <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth the way of Grace, that his Diſciples might adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But here you will object ſtill; Well,
<note n="3" place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> if <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſpenſation or Covenant which he was the Mediator of, was a Covenant of Grace, and not of Works for Juſtification, why is it called a kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Letter, a Miniſtration of Death, a Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Condemnation, as it is 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.6, 7, 9.

            <p n="2">2dly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I anſwer, That theſe two are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent; it might prove a miniſtration of death to them, and yet be a way of grace and life in it ſelf; ſo is the plaineſt Goſpel in the World a ſavour of death unto the diſobedient and unbelievers, that yet is certainly in the great intendment of it a way of grace and life.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Law proved a miniſtration of death to many of them, becauſe they miſtook it for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, though it were not given with that intention; they did not ſee the Grace that was contained in it. There was a vail upon their heart, and is to this day upon the hearts of many of the <hi>Jews; their minds were blinded, ſo that the Children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly look to the end of that which is aloliſhed,</hi> they could not ſee Chriſt the end of the Law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> There is thus much indeed to be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the diſpenſation it ſelf, that it was dark and obſcure; the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had not onely blinded eyes, and a vailed heart, but <hi>Moſes</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Vail upon his face, ver. 13. which was one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they could not ſee that Grace which was in his Diſpenſation. <hi>Moſes</hi> had a vail over his face, ſo that they could not look ſtedfaſtly to the end of his Diſpenſation.
<note place="margin">The fault of the firſt Covenant.</note> There was ſome kind of fault as it were in the Law it ſelf, ſo the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64817:48"/>8.7. <hi>For if that firſt Covenant had been faultleſs, there ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> What this fault was, is commonly known and diſcourſed, and it was the obſcurity of it; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of it were not ſo plain; &amp; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt is the Mediator of a better Covenant, eſtabliſht upon better promiſes,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>There was a Covenant of works inſerted in their Dispenſation.</hi> Elſe how could the Apoſtle give you a deſcription of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of it out of <hi>Moſes?</hi> Which he doth both in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>And no caveat entred in the place where the Covenant of Works is delivered: 'Tis true, the ſame Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs of Faith too; but an inobſervant Reader might chance to miſtake the Covenant of Works for his way to Heaven, as well as take the Covenant of Grace for his way;</hi> and they might keep in that way all their lives, if they were not ſtrict obſervers of the effects of that way upon their Conſciences, which was to gall and ſting them, and weary them out of their very lives, till they came to the way of Grace. And thus we find the generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> did miſtake, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined themſelves by it; ſo that unleſs God had by a wonderful hand, as he plucked <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and perhaps by irreſiſtable illuminations and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, brought a remnant to himſelf, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been burnt up by the Wrath of God; they had been as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Rom.</hi> 9.29. to the end: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1.2.3. I might well tranſcribe every word of theſe eight Verſes.</p>
            <p>Now this was the fault which God found with his firſt Covenant; that though it were a Covenant of Grace, yet he is ſo gracious, that he thought it was not plain enough to ſave the generality of them; they would be ſtill miſtaking and miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I ſay, the fault was laid upon the covenant, which yet was a covenant of Grace: Now what other fault it could be then this, that the Lord did not think it gracious enough, I cannot imagine; and I think that is the fault the Scripture pitcheth upon: Now becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Diſpenſation, or the firſt covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was thus faulty, had a covenant of Works in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Lev.</hi> 18.5. for the deſcription of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal righteouſneſs, we have theſe words, <hi>Ye ſhall therefore keep mp Seatutes and my Judgements, which if a man do, he ſhall live in them: I am the Lord.</hi> So in the fore-going verſes 1, 2. <hi>And the Lord spake unto Moſes, ſaying Speak unto the children of Iſrael, and ſay unto them, I am the Lord your God;</hi> then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the three verſes wherein the covenant of Works is deſcribed; ver. 3. <hi>After the doings of the Land of Aegypt wherein ye dwelt, ſhall ye not do; and after the doings of the Land of Canaan, whither I bring you; ſhall ye not do; neither ſhall ye walk in their Ordinancee. Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Ye ſhall do my Judgements, and keep mine Ordinances, to walk therein; I am the Lord your God. Ver,</hi> 5. <hi>Ye ſhall therefore keep my Statutes,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64817:50"/>and my Judgements, which if a man do, he ſhall live in them: I am the Lord.</hi> Here I obſerve, 1. The ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and plainneſs of the delivery of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which contain the covenant of Works; they are delivered without any caveat or caution to the Reader, leſt he ſhould miſtake this for his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which he ſhould be ſaved by. 2. I obſerve the Authority and Majeſty they are delivered with; even with this addition three ſeveral times in the compaſs of four verſes, <hi>I am the Lord, and I am the Lord your God.</hi> This doth not look like an old antiquated covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> about 2000. years before, and of uſe to him, but onely for the ſtrſt day of his creation: I conclude therefore ſaith the objector, That it is a valid covenant, and delivered with intention that men ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it; And beſides I add that which hath great ſtrength in it, That even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats this covenant of Works in <hi>Moſes</hi> his own Words, and directs a man to this covenant for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that came to ask of him what he ſhould do to be ſaved; the place is, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>And behold a certain Lawyer ſtood up and tempted him, ſaying, Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherit eternal life? He ſaid unto him, What is written in the Law? How readeſt thou?</hi> Chriſt ſends him to the Law; and you ſhall ſee it is not to the Law in a large ſence, as it comprehends both a covenant of Works and a covenant of Grace; but to the Law taken ſtrictly for a covenant of Works; it follows therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>The Lawyer anſwering, ſaid, The Law ſaith, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thy ſelf: And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thou haſt anſwered right; this do, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64817:50"/>thou ſhalt live;</hi> which are the very words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> where he deſcribes a legal righteouſneſs; From whence I conclude, That the Covenant of Works is ſtill good unto Juſtification; the Covenant of Works is ſtill in force; elſe <hi>Moſes</hi> would never have delivered it in that ſimplicity, and with that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; elſe Jeſus Chriſt himſelf would never have directed one unto it, to get eternal life by it.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed did deliver a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as truly as he did a covenant of Grace, and that without any caution (that I can find) in the place where it is delivered; and I think I may ſay alſo, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt did deliver a Covenant of Works too, in that 10. of <hi>Luke</hi> above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>And 2dly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I may add, There was very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they might, and why they did. For that the covenant of Works is ſtill in force, all men by nature are under it; for it is nothing but the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law of our creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">All men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works.</note> There was indeed a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law beſides given to <hi>Adam;</hi> but the obſerving of it needed not have created any trouble to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man: All men are naturally under a covenant of Works, for they are naturally under the Law of their Creation, which is the covenant of Works. Yea the Saints themſelves are not freed from it, any further then from the condemning power of it, by Chriſts having ſuffered the penalty for them. That all men are naturally under the Law, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a covenant of Works, which are all one, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, for that all thoſe whom Chriſt came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, were under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. which muſt be meant of the Law, ſtrictly taken for a covenant of Works; for elſe none but the <hi>Jews</hi> and proſelyted Gentiles were under the Law, as delivered by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:64817:51"/>whereas in that Scripture it is plain, that all thoſe whom Chriſt came to redeem, were under the Law; therefore it is meant under the Law as a covenant of Works. Beſides, the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. the firſt ſix verſes, argues thus, That the conſcience or ſoul of a man muſt either be married to the Law as its Husband, or to Chriſt as its Husband; and till it is marryed to Chriſt, the Law is its natural Husband; but when it is married to Chriſt, the law is its husband no longer; therefore till a man come to Chriſt, he is under a covenant of Works; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men naturally are under a covenant of Works, for no man is in Chriſt by nature.</p>
            <p>I anſwer in the third place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That it's true, <hi>Moſes</hi> and our Saviour both preached a covenant of Works, as well as a covenant of Grace; and well might, becauſe all men are naturally under it: Yet neither our Saviour, nor <hi>Moſes</hi> did it, with deſign to make men ſeek juſtification by Works, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to burthen mens conſciences with inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loads of guilt, that ſo they might readily flee to the hope that was ſet before them in the covenant of Grace, which they had together with the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works in the ſame Diſpenſation; That <hi>Moſes</hi> did it with this deſign, St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, as I have ſhewn in ſeveral places; the law entred that the offence might abound, and ſo was a School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto Chriſt: And that our Saviour did it with this deſign, the place quoted in the objection will ſufficiently evidence, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.25. to the 28.25. <hi>v. Behold a certain Lawyer ſtood up and tempted him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Maſter what ſhall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> Here this Lawyer came not with a good intention; for it is ſaid he ſtood up and tempted our Saviour, made the queſtion rather to ſee what our Saviour would
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64817:51"/>ſay, then to get any ſatisfaction to himſelf; and in the 29. <hi>ver.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>This Lawyer was willing to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie himſelf.</hi> Now how could the pride of this tempting Lawyer be better repreſſed, then by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to the Law, to a covenant of Works; which if he would but ſet himſelf in earneſt to keep, would quickly prick the bladder of his pride; and let out that wind with which he was ſo ſwoln, as to dare come and tempt Chriſt, and juſtifie himſelf? But now our Saviour takes another courſe with the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who after ſhe was tryed with a knock or two, with ſome harſh words, ſo as to be called Dog, yet continuing humble and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, had her faith extolled by our Saviour, and is ſtrengthened with the higheſt conſolations; as we have the ſtory, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to <hi>ver.</hi> 29. Thus God reſiſteth the proud, he hath a Covenant of Works to oppoſe them withall; but he giveth Grace, and ſheweth Mercy to the humble; he hath a covenant of Grace to comfort them with.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>5</label> There is one objection yet more concerning the ceremonial law, which I did not mention at the firſt, and it is this, Certainly it appears from the ceremonial law, that the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was given to them for a covenant of Works; elſe why had they ſuch multitude of ceremonies impoſed upon them, if they were not to have life for the obſervation and doing of them, together with the duties of the moral Law? And it is very obſervable, that in that place of <hi>Leviticus</hi> which the Apoſtle quotes, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the righteouſneſs of the law, the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are as ſtrictly enjoined as the moral duties of the law are, with this <hi>badge</hi> of the law of works upon them, <hi>The man that doth them, ſhall live in them, Lev.</hi> 18.4, 5. <hi>Ye ſhall do my Judgements;</hi> that is,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64817:52"/>ſay Commentors, my judicial Laws, <hi>and keep mine Ordinances;</hi> that is, ſay they, either moral or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial; ſo in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>You ſhall therefore keep my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Judgements, which if a man do, he ſhall live in them; I am the Lord.</hi> Now hence I argue, ſaith the Objector, Here you have acknowledged, is a covenant of Works deſcribed. Now here is their whole Diſpenſation by <hi>Moſes,</hi> of laws moral, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, and judicial, contained; therefore their whole Diſpenſation was a covenant of Works; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if the Law moral alone, which you have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the law of Nature, he of it ſelf a covenant of Works, as it ſeems to have been to <hi>Adam,</hi> who had but a few other commands beſides, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as we call Poſitive; and if every man by Nature be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a covenant of works (though a ſtranger to the Old-Teſtament or New, as having never heard of either) being under the law of his creation; how much more were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under a covenant of Works, who, beſides the moral law, had the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and ceremonial added for them to obſerve, and altogether given them vvith this language of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, theſe ye ſhall obſerve, which if a man do, he ſhall live in them; <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> I ſhal add onely one obſervation more to ſtrengthen the objection, and it is this, That when St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes againſt the <hi>Galatians</hi> for embracing a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, moſt of his Work lyes in beating them off from the ceremonial law, vvhich they were exceedingly addicted to, as looking upon the lavv of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be very much of the nature of the covenant of Works, and the ceremonial law as a great ſign of it, there being ſo much vvork cut out for them in it, and verily believing that if they vvere pretty ſtrict in keeping the ceremonial law,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64817:52"/>God vvould juſtifie and ſave them. Therefore it is very probable, that the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was given to them as a covenant of Works, for this reaſon as well as others, that there were ſo many ceremonies appointed for them to obſerve; moſt of which it is more then probable the greater number did not underſtand, and ſo muſt take up, und ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the <hi>Work done,</hi> then which, vvhat can look more like a covenant of vvorks, for men to do a great many things which they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, meerly becauſe God had commanded them? Now for anſwer to this objection, and I ſhall give it in ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">A. </seg>1</label> I confeſs that the ceremonial law proved a great ſnare and a ſtumbling-block unto the careleſs <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Galatians;</hi> for when they found ſuch a great task of ceremonies ſet them, they cared not much to ſtudy the meaning of them, but took up with the doing of them, which to do, did not much trouble their hearts or conſciences, and ſo placed themſelves by it under a covenant of vvorks, in their treating with God for Juſtification.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, I grant that the ceremonial law was a great burthen, and an unſupportable yoke even to thoſe that were good amongſt the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 15.10. and it is a great piece of the liberty of the Goſpel, to be freed from it.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, I grant that the laws moral, judicial, and ceremonial, were given altogether, and are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that place, where a covenant of vvorks, or the righteouſneſs of the Law is ſaid to be deſcribed by the Apoſtle; and I grant in this particular, that though the law of nature alone is a covenant of vvorks to thoſe that are in a ſtate of nature, though they never received any poſitive law from God;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64817:53"/>yet that it is poſſible for a ceremonial lavv, or a law conſiſting of many ceremonies, or poſitive laws to be a part of a covenant of vvorks; as we find in <hi>Adam's</hi> covenant of works, there was a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſome reckon it, of the Tree of life; and there was a poſitive law concerning the forbidden fruit, which vvere neither of them branches of the law of Nature; and he might have been as well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden as allowed all the trees ſave one, if the Lord had pleaſed; he might have had a ſyſteme of poſitive and ceremonial laws inſerted in his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of vvorks, if the Lord had thought good, and no wrong had been done him; for he was able to have kept them.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Yet here I deny that the ceremonial law was any part of a covenant of works, though brought in near that place where the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the law is ſaid by the Apoſtle to be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and that for this reaſon, which fully anſwers the objection: That the ceremonial law did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Goſpel in it, which cannot be ſaid of any branch of the covenant of works: I allowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed above, that the law taken ſtrictly for a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, did preach the Goſpel virtually or by conſequence, as it burthened the ſinners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſo made him ſeek further for a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; but I ſaid then, it is the law taken in a large ſence onely as it contains the whole Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament or at leaſt a conſiderable part of it, that teacheth Chriſt and the Goſpel formally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly. VVhy now the ceremonial law teacheth Chriſt in many, perhaps in all the parts of it, if wel underſtood. VVhat could the ſhedding of ſo much blood for remiſſion of ſins ſignifie, but the ſhedding of Chriſts blood for them and us all, which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64817:53"/>is the great myſterie of the Goſpel? Now if any ſay they underſtood it not, and yet muſt do it, and ſo it was all one to them as if it had not ſingnified any thing at all; and therefore muſt ſtill paſs with them as a covenant of works.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1 in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 3. What though ſome did not believe, did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, <hi>muſt their unbelief</hi> and ignorance <hi>make the Faith of God,</hi> that Doctrine of Faith which the ceremonial law preached, <hi>of none effect,</hi> or ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? But you will ſay, they could not ſee the blood of Chriſt in the blood of a ſacrifice, having no clearer diſcoveries then they had of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> I anſ. I confeſs I cannot ſay they could ſee ſo much, though ſtill ſo much was contained in it, as now we well underſtand. But yet if they could not ſee ſo much, yet ſomewhat they might have learned; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God appoints no idle, uſeleſs, inſignificant ceremonies in his Worſhip; therefore I ſuppoſe they might have learnt thus much by their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and particularly by their ſacrifices, which I ſuppoſe was known even amongſt Heathens in their ſacrifices, that when they killed a Beaſt for attoning the anger of God, here life went for life, and God might as well have taken their lives from them, as accepted the life of that Beaſt; and ſo by this they might ſee that their lives and ſalvations did depend purely upon the Mercy and Grace of God; now this ſufficiently weaned them from the law or covenant of works, which had no Grace or Pardon in it; it was therefore the groſſeſt miſtake of all to underſtand the ceremonial law for a part of the covenant of Works, when it was greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a Goſpel to them.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64817:54"/>5thly and laſtly, If yet it were dark, and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them with the multitude of duties which it impoſed; Why might it not herein do the good turn that a covenant of Works did for them? Which was to make them ſtudy and ſearch, and long for the pure and clear diſcoveries of that rich Grace which we now ſee in the dayes of the Goſpel? I have now done with this objection alſo, which I of purpoſe kept out from the reſt, in which I only conſidered the moral law as a covenant of Works, for theſe two reaſons: 1. For that the ceremonial law neither was, nor could be a part of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, which the moral law both was, and is to all that are under a covenant of works. 2dly, and conſequently, I therefore kept off from any conſideration of the ceremonial law, in my diſcourſes about the law its being given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that ſo I might have my diſcourſe run clear in the buſineſs of the covenant of works, and draw a line in it from <hi>Adams</hi> eſtate in innocency, to the very days of the Goſpel, which with any mixture of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about the ceremonial law, would have been broken and diſturbed. VVhereas now you ſee the law taken ſtrictly for a covenant of works, might have juſtified <hi>Adam,</hi> but could not juſtifie the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and therefore though added to the promiſe given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a covenant of works, yet was never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with deſign that they ſhould accept it for ſuch unto Juſtification; which appears from this double demonſtration, as I may call it, <hi>a priori, &amp; a poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori. A priori,</hi> for that before the law was given there was a covenant of Grace, which the law could not come in to diſannul; and <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> for that the very ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> that brought their law
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64817:54"/>from God out of the Mount, did not more truly acquaint them with the nature of a legal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, then he did with the righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. <hi>But the righteouſneſs of faith ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on this wiſe, Say not in thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> being a text quoted out of the ſame <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 30.11. which make this argument, vvherefore ſhould <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt deſcribe to you a legal righteouſneſs, and tell you, as appears by clear conſequence out of him, that ye cannot attain unto that righteouſneſs, and then deſcribe unto you the righteouſneſs of faith; but for this end, that ye might forgo the one, &amp; cleave to the other? And there are infinite places in other Scriptures of the Old-Teſtament, which give their teſtimony to Chriſt, and the Righteouſneſs of Faith, which ſufficiently argue, that the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament never went about to eſtabliſh a way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the Law.</p>
            <p>And here I think it may be of great uſe to ſearch into this place of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the Apoſtle aſſerts to contain the deſcription of the righteouſneſs which is by faith, that ſo we may find both that it is ſo, and what this righteouſneſs of faith is. The place is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11. to 15. quoted and paraphraſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8, 9.
<note place="margin">An inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the ſenſe of <hi>Deut:</hi> 30 11, 12</note> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. <hi>But the righteouſneſs which is of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thine heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? &amp;c.</hi> clearly referring to <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, 12,—as any may ſee in the Margent of their Bibles. Now let us go to that place in <hi>Deut.</hi> and ſee what Goſpel there is in it, and how evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that there is Goſpel in it. The words are theſe: <hi>For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64817:55"/>it is not in heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Who ſhall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? but the Word is nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayeſt do it.</hi> This is the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, in which the covenant of Grace, or the righteouſneſs of Faith is deſcribed, according to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> But how is the Goſpel or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith deſcribed here? Firſt of all, I muſt ſeparate that which doth not ſeem to look like Goſpel, from that which is pure Goſpel, in this place: And here we may obſerve, That the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Goſpel ſpoken of, is the law or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which he had delivered to them; <hi>This Commandment which I command thee this day;</hi> the ſame which is ſpoken of (as I think, there being no viſible difference as to matter) in <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. the place aſſerted by the Apoſtle to contain a legal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; it was for matter, the law of <hi>Moſes; This Commandment,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which I command thee this day.</hi> Again. I think it will appear to be meant of the ten commandments, becauſe it is added, That <hi>Commandment which I command thee, is not far from thee, but is nigh thee, even in thy heart and mouth:</hi> Now the ceremonial law was not written in their heart; neither had all the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor the generality of them to whom yet this is ſpoken, been taught the law effectually by the Spirit of God, ſo as that ſhould be the ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>This Commandment is in thine heart;</hi> and indeed, that is the promiſe of the new Covenant, not of this by <hi>Moſes;</hi> but the effect of the Moral law was in their

            <p>Laſtly, Another thing in this Paragraph that will not ſeem perhaps to ſome to look like Goſpel, is this. That all the comfort of this Goſpel by <hi>Moſes,</hi> lies in Doing. This Commandment (ſaith he) is not far off, but in thy heart and in thy mouth, that thou mayeſt do it; and ſo obtain life and juſtification by it: This ſeems to look right like that place in <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitious</hi> ſo often mentioned, where <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to deſcribe a Legal Righteouſneſs; <hi>The man that doth them, ſhall live in them:</hi> And ſo in all the Chapter
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64817:56"/>after, there is bleſſing if they do the command and curſing if they do not; this to ſome may not look like Goſpel. But yet here is the Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wherein doth it lie?
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VVherein is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this place of</hi> Deut.</note> or how will it appear? I have ſhewed wherein it cannot lie, or doth not ſeem to lie; I will ſhew yet wherein it muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and wherein it is viſibly expreſſed, and that is, in that eaſineſs which <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ſo much inſiſt upon in this Scripture of doing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. The Commandment for the matter of it was perhaps the ſame with the Covenant of Works; and Doing (partly at leaſt) brought in the reward of it, that is, Juſtification: But is this the Language of a Covenant of Works think you, to fallen man, ſuch as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were? The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is eaſie; there are no ſuch difficulties in keeping it, as you may imagine; ye ſhall not need to climb as high as Heaven after it, nor to coaſt all Lands, and compaſs the Ocean for it; propoſe no ſuch vaſt undertakings to thy ſelf for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it, for thou needeſt not; the Word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, that is near; yea but near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er yet, in thine heart, that thou mayeſt do it, and thou mayeſt do it with eaſe and ſweetneſs; No, I have ſhewn at large, that the Covenant of Works, or the Law taken ſtrictly as a way of Juſtification, ſerves now to ſinners onely to terrifie their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with laying home its charge; it hath no ſuch comfortable words in it; nay I ſhewed out of the Scripture, that it is an utter impoſſibility that the Law ſhould be done by a ſinner ſo as to juſtifie him: A man might as well climb up to Heaven, or compaſs the vaſt Ocean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea (to add another im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſſibility which the Apoſtle adds in his Paraphraſ upon this Text in <hi>Deut.</hi> a man might as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64817:56"/>into the infernal Abyſs, and make a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as be juſtified by the Law: This therefore cannot be the Language of the Law. But now take the keeping the Law in a Goſpel-ſence (as perhaps that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. is to be underſtood, where the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law is ſaid to be fulfilled in us, that walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit) and then the Goſpel in this Scripture is obvious; it is eaſie to keep the Law now, even that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded them, even the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law; that is, to keep it ſincerely, not exactly to a tittle, but in the ſubſtance of it: This Word therefore which <hi>Moſes</hi> means when he ſays, <hi>The word is nigh thee,</hi> as the Apoſtle adds in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, muſt be the <hi>word of faith</hi> which he preached. <hi>The Word is nigh thee;</hi> that is, not the Word of the Moral law taken in its utmoſt exactneſs, to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a tittle; this is not nigh thee; it is as far as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, further then either of the <hi>Indies,</hi> further then Hell it ſelf; thou ſinner canſt never attain unto it, to do it. But yet the Word of the ſame Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a moderated ſenſe, in the gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God, where ſincere obedience is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for unerring obſervance of it; <hi>This Word is nigh thee, even in thy heart and in thy month, that thou mayeſt do it; and it is</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Word of Faith which we preach;</hi> this the new creature can undertake with the aſſiſtance of God, even the keeping the Commandments of God in an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical manner, through Faith, which works by Love: Here thou doſt not claim thy wages upon thy doings, as if they deſerved it; or as if they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the letter of the Law; and ſo thou comeſt not to the Law for thy Juſtification; but though the great Rule of thine obedience be the Law, yet thou goeſt to the Goſpel for thy Juſtification; thou
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64817:57"/>comeſt by Faith to the Promiſe, and Goodneſs, and Grace of God for thy Juſtification. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is nothing but Faith will encourage thee in ſuch a keeping of the Law as this is. The Law ſtrictly taken, will diſhearten thee; that will thus reaſon the caſe with thee: VVhat are all thy works, what is all thy obedience, ſo long as thoughaſt broken ſuch and ſuch a Commandment, haſt omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch and ſuch a duty? What is thy ſincerity good for? What is thy good meaning and real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention worth? I muſt have a full task performed; I muſt have unerring, never-failing obedience, or elſe I muſt curſe thee with all the curſes which thou findeſt written againſt ſinners: Now the Soul by Faith thus anſwereth the Law: 'Tis true, were I to ſtand to thy award, it muſt be all as thou haſt ſaid; but I am upon other terms with the Lord for my Juſtification; I am upon terms of Grace and Mercy, of which there are no footſteps in thy whole way of Juſtification; and though I was born under thy power, yet <hi>I</hi> have a Saviour that hath freed me from under it, by ſuffering the penalty for my breach of it; and now I am aſſured, That if I walk faithfully, and deal honeſtly with God, endeavouring in ſincerity to walk after the Spirit, to do all the Wills of God from the heart, my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience will now be as well accepted, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring obedience would once have been. Thus you ſee, Faith bears off from coming to a legal-Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Faith bears up the Soul againſt all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations of the Law with it, and againſt all the accuſations of Satan in the Conſcienc, and yet doth keep the ſoul intent upon the deſign of univerſal obedience to the pure and holy Law of God. Faith requires thy obedience to the Law; the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Faith doth eſtabliſh the Law; and yet the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64817:57"/>Law in this moderated ſenſe onely obſerved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires thee to go, or rather takes for granted that thou goeſt to Grace, Mercy and Pardon by Faith, for that thou art not an exact Doer of the Law. So I have ſhewn how this place in <hi>Deut.</hi> ſeems to ſpeak Law, yet muſt be underſtood to ſpeak Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and what Goſpel that is which it ſpeaks. Yet I may not expect to go off without oppoſition in this interpretation; and I am ſenſible that theſe two or three things will be objected againſt me,
<note n="3" place="margin">Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, 12.</note> 1. That I make Faith too eaſie a buſineſs, as if thoſe that could not keep the Law, are yet able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; whereas ſome think it as hard a buſineſs to believe, as to keep the whole Law. 2. They'l ſay, That I make the Goſpel but a Covenant of works in a new dreſs, and ſubſtitute Evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the room of Legal, as the matter of our Juſtification. 3. They may perhaps add, that I leave out the great Goſpel-myſterie, which according to the Apoſtle is contained in <hi>Deut.</hi> and that is Chriſt. That which <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſeth thus, <hi>the Commandment which I command thee, is not in heaven, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, Who ſhall aſcend for us into Heaven, &amp; bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it;</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth thus, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend for us into Heaven, (that is, to bring Chriſt down from above; or who ſhall deſcend into the deep? that is, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead.) But what ſaith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart; and</hi> (leaving out, <hi>that thou mayeſt do it,</hi> he addeth) <hi>the Word of Faith which we preach, that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhall believe in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Here we ſee the Apoſtle ſinds Chriſt in all that ſpeech of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and it was Faith on him
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64817:58"/>that juſtified; therefore it was not a keeping of the Law according to ſincerity, inſtead of unerring obedience, which <hi>Moſes</hi> meant, and ſo the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given of <hi>Moſes</hi> is uſeleſs. Now I ſhall anſwer firſt this laſt objection againſt the interpretation of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Covenant of Grace, and then come to the other two objections; and I ſhall do it in the words of truth, (as I hope) I am ſure in the words ſoberneſs.
<note place="margin">The laſt objection firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> 1. I do believe all this, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle adds by way of Paraphraſe, to agree wel with the words of <hi>Moſes.</hi> 2. That yet I cannot believe that any ordinary Saint, or any other then ſome mightily inſpired by God, like an Apoſtle, could have underſtood all that in <hi>Moſes</hi> his words, when they were firſt delivered, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt ſhould deſcend into the deep, and after that be raiſed from the dead, and aſcend into Heaven, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes; <hi>Say not in thine heart, Who ſhall aſcend for us into Heaven, and bring the Word from thence, that we may hear it, and do it?</hi> Or becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes, <hi>Who ſhall go for us beyond the Seas, and bring the Word unto us?</hi>—Neither can I believe that it was their duty in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time to confeſs with their mouth the Lord Jeſus, or to believe in their heart that God had raiſed him from the dead (a thing which was not at that time true) I ſay, I do not think it was their duty to believe it, becauſe to us it is contained in the Word of Faith, to wit, the Goſpel which the Apoſtle preached. Neither do I believe that it was a neceſſary duty of that time, ſo much as to believe that God would raiſe Chriſt from the dead, and that for this reaſon; For all the Apoſtles in the dayes of Chriſt's Fleſh, were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this Myſtery; yea, did not believe it, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it after Chriſt had told them of it, as is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64817:58"/>very plein in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. from 31. to 35. The reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the words of that Text is plain proof enough, without urging them by force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 31. <hi>Then he took unto him the twelve, and ſaid unto them, Behold, we go up to Jeruſalem, and all things that are written by the Prophets concerning the Son of Man, ſhall be accompliſhed.</hi> Ver. 33. <hi>They ſhall ſcourge him, and put him to death, and the third day he ſhall riſe again.</hi> Now it is ſaid ver. 34. <hi>that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood none of theſe things; and this ſaying was hid from them; neither knew they the things that were ſpoken.</hi> Therefore certainly theſe things were not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be known and believed in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time: And therefore, though there be ſo much Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Text of <hi>Deut.</hi> to us, now that the Apoſtle hath diſcovered it, (unleſs we will ſay, they are additional gloſſes upon that Text of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which perhaps may prove no falſe Divinity) I ſay, Permit all that be contained to us in that Text of <hi>Deut.</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath diſcovered in it, yet by them under the Old-Teſtament (as I think) there could be no more underſtood then this; That they were not to lay it upon themſelves as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſalvation, and ſo unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to keep the whole Law in the ſtrictneſs of it, but that they were to minde the keeping of it from their heart, to turn unto the Lord their God with all their heart, and with all their ſouls, and ſo to keepe his Commandments and his Statutes which are written in this Book of the Law, as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 10. immediately preceding thoſe Verſes in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. where the righteouſneſs of Faith is ſaid to be deſcribed, and this to do, to keep the Law with all their heart ſincerely, they ſhould find ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and pleaſant; whenas for a ſtrict Covenant of Works, <hi>Do this, and thou ſhalt live,</hi> they would find
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64817:59"/>it an unſupportable yoke and burthen.</p>
            <p>Now I come to anſwer thoſe other two objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt my interpretation;
<note place="margin">The firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 line">
                     <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
                  </gap> anſwered.</note> the firſt is this, That I make Faith too eaſie athing in compariſon of keeping the Law; whereas many good men judg it a hard to believe, as to keep the whole Law:</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. That indeed I do think the way of Faith to be an eaſier way in it ſelf then keeping the whole Law: For I ask any ſober man, Whether it be not eaſier to keep the Law in a ſincere manner, that is, to guide my actions onely by the rule of it, and honeſtly to endeavour toconform to it, though in ſome things I fail) if this be not eaſier, then the exact keeping the Law to a tittle? The queſtion I ſuppoſe is anſwered as ſoon as made. Why then I ſay, I look upon the way of believing to be this: Corning to God humbling my ſelf for my ſins, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting my ſelf to his ſervice, and walking faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him,

               </gap>mmortality: In one word, It is an Honeſty to God, upon terms of Grace, and I being honeſt and true to him, doubt not of his faithfulneſs to me, for pardoning my ſins, and providing for me here, and ſaving me here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Erge,</hi> if this be Faith (for proof of which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to my interpretation, and require a better or fairer in confutation of it) I ſay, if this be faith, then the way of Faith is eaſier then keeping the whole Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But yet I have not ſaid, that though it be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, yet it is in a mans own power to believe; it is not i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a man's own power to move a finger with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, and it is equally impoſſible without God to move a ſinger, and to remove a Mountain; yet there is no man in his right wits but will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64817:59"/>that it is eaſier in it ſelf to move a ſinger, then to remove a Mountain. The laſt objection is this:</p>
            <p>But then you ſubſtitute Evangelical works in the room of Legal; and ſo ſtill you turn the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection anſwered</note> which is called the Law of Faith, into a Covenant of Works.</p>
            <p>Now for this objection, I confeſs it hath ſome weight in it, though for thoſe that make it, they are uſually ſoaring in high notions, and ſtrangely wedded unto their own apprehenſions, and are ſomewhat of an <hi>Antinomian</hi> ſtrain; yet I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it may be made by a ſober man: I ſhould prevent my ſelf in what I have to ſay in the following part of this Treatiſe, if I ſhould anſwer it at large in this place; yet to give ſome taſte of an anſwer here, I make this diſtinction; That there are indeed two wayes of running upon a Covenant of works, either in whole, or in part.
<note place="margin">Two ways of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works</note> 1. Either upon a Covenant of Works purely and ſtrictly, ſo none durſt touch or meddle with it. 2. Upon it in part, ſo as to mix it with the Goſpel. <hi>A.</hi> Now I anſwer therefore, That indeed our great care is to be laid out about avoiding of theſe mixtures of legality in our treating with God for Juſtification; and that is the great deſign of this Treatiſe, to caveat us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe mixtures which we are very apt to be ſaulty in, as <hi>I</hi> hope they ſhall ſee in the ſequel of my Diſcourſe, that pleaſe to go on in it. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have ſeen, that there is Goſpel in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and what this Goſpel in the Law is; as alſo, that the reaſon why it was delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> could be no other, but to put his Diſciples upon the way of believing, for Juſtification. There are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places in <hi>Moſes,</hi> eſpecially in the Book of <hi>Deut.</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:64817:60"/>that have much Goſpel in them. I ſhall onely add one Allegorical or Typical Argument, which yet I think hath much evidence in it, to prove that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had Goſpel in it; it is this: That the Law of the two Tables when it was written the ſecond time by <hi>Moſes</hi> from the mouth of God, or elſe by the ſinger of God himſelf, are ordained by God to be put in the Ark, and the Ark to be put under the Mercy-ſeat, and Cherubims to cover the Mercy-Seat, and the preſence of God eminently promiſed to be found between thoſe Cherubins, <hi>Exod</hi> 25.21, 22. <hi>Thou ſhalt put the Mercy-Seat above upon the Ark, and in the Ark thou ſhalt put the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that I ſhall give thee, and there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat, from between the two Cherubims which are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ark of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſtimony of All things, &amp;c.</hi> Hence I frame this argument; If the Law be hid in the Ark, which alone ſeems to be an inſtrument of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and this Ark placed under the Mercy-Seat; the <hi>Greek</hi> word for which, being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is in <hi>Rom</hi> 3 25. applyed to Chriſt, and tranſlated <hi>Propitiation,—whom God hath ſet forth to be a</hi> Propitation <hi>through Faith in his Blood;</hi> and the preſence of God eminently promiſed to them upon this Mercy-Seat or Throne of Grace, then the Law which was in its own nature a Covenant of Works, and to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners a killing-letter, was yet to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and covered with Grace and Mercy, (Mercy rejoicing againſt, or triumphing over Judgement, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13.) and they defended and protected from the wrath and curſe of it, by a gracious preſence of God with them: that Chriſt's offering was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed betwixt the Law and them, and that this was in ſome ſort (though more darkly then to us)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64817:60"/>ſignified and diſcovered to them, and ſo, that the law was never given them with this deſign, that they ſhould ſeek Juſtification by it as a Covenant of Works.</p>
            <p>I have done with the objections of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which may be made againſt my firſt Poſition, that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not, cannot be by the Law; that it is, and muſt be by faith, all which were made by occaſion of the Old-Teſtament Diſpenſation, chiefly the giving of the Law by <hi>Moſes.</hi> I ſhall before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the more Doctrinal part of my Treatiſe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention an objection which might be made on behalf of the Gentiles, againſt Juſtification by Faith, and for Juſtification by the Law: And it is this.</p>
            <p>You have ſaid that the Law of our Creation is naturally a Covenat of Works,
<note place="margin">The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in behalf of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith.</note> and that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had the Law, or the effect and ſubſtance of it written in their hearts, and we read not of any Promiſes that they had; therefore either they could not be juſtified at all, or they muſt be juſtified by the law.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: 1. All are not of Opinion that the Heathens were in a juſtifiable condition till Chriſt was explicitely and plainly preached to them; and for thoſe that are not of it, they will meet with no difficulty in this Objection; for, if the Heathens could not be juſtified at all, it ceaſeth the enquiry which way they were to be juſtified</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some are of Opinion, That God never made any creatures under an utter impoſſibility of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, and being made happy by him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore in a conſonancy to my preceding Diſcourſe, I ſay, If it can be made appear that the Heathens without the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64817:61"/>tures of the Old-Teſtament could not diſcover ſo much of the Goodneſs, Grace, Mercy, and Love of God to mankind, as upon which to ground a lively hope, an unfeigned and operative faith, that God was ready upon their repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, to forgive their ſins, and to be at peace with them; the ſecond opinion is to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the firſt received: For, I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if the Heathens were any of them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or in a poſſibility to be ſaved and juſtified, it muſt be by their treating of God in the way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, for that the law was rendred utterly weak, and unable to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſtifie ſo much as one ſinner. Now becauſe I do not think it convenient in this place to engage in that controverſie, Whether or no the Gentiles were in a ſalvable condition; I ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produce the Scriptures which ſeem to prove they had ſufficient Goſpel-light to produce Faith, (which they muſt have if they were ſaved) nor the others, which would ſeem to prove that they had no ſuch light.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude this firſt part, having proved it <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> on the Gentiles part, that if any of them were ſaved, it muſt be by faith, and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> notwithſtanding all the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary, that they were under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and that the law was never given to them to put them upon ſeeking Juſtification by the works of it. The firſt great Propoſitions which were under demonſtration, ſtill ſtand firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en; That the law is no way to ſinners for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; That Faith is a way, and the onely way; and that God hath ſet up this way, without which all mankind muſt have periſhed, and that he hath led his people in this way throughout all ages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64817:61"/>the law, and under the law; that as they were all under ſin by the law, ſo they were likewiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſcoveries of Grace for their Juſtification by Faith: I come now to ſome more practical and experimental inquiries, which I ſhall introduce with an uſe of Conviction and Reprehenſion from the Doctrinal part of the foregoing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>VVE have ſeen in the foregoing Diſcourſe, that there are but two wayes of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the one by Works, the other by Faith; that theſe two are oppoſite one to the other; that the Law or Works is now no way to fallen man, but Faith onely; that all that ever were juſtified, were juſtified by faith, even <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and all the Saints of God under the Old-Teſtament, all the Saints before the giving of the law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ever after; yea the Gentiles themſelves, if any were ſaved, muſt be ſaved this way.
<note place="margin">An uſe Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reproof</note> How greatly then are they miſtaken, that even under the Goſpel will needs be juſtified by Works? This falls with clear evidence of conviction and reprehenſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a generation of men; and yet ſuch there are in abundance (who would think it!) even at this day; yea the greateſt part of profeſſors run this way. Although man be turned out of Paradice, (which was his place of Juſtification by Works) and at the door a Cherubin be ſet with a flaming Sword to diſpute the paſſage, yet they will needs enter again, though they venture life and ſoul and all. Though Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> be covered all over with ſmoke, though they hear the thunderings, ſee the lightnings, feel the Earth quake at a diſtance, and

            <p>Now to ſet home this Conviction and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, Conſider that there are theſe four great iniquities found in a legal Spirit: 1. An horrible perverſneſs and ſelf-willednefs; When God would have them go one way, they will go another; <hi>

                  </gap> right couſneſs of God is revealed in the Gospel, from faith to faith, as it is written, The Juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17. And they give God the lye, and ſay, The Juſt ſhall live by Works, and will go the quite oppoſite and contraty way 2. Here we ſee their intollerable pride, which is the root of this
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64817:62"/>ſelf-willedneſs; they will not be juſtified by Gods Righteouſneſs, but by their own Righteouſneſs; they prefer their own Way to God's, their own diſ-approved Works, to God's approved Way of Righteouſneſs. 3. Here we ſee the ſottiſh ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, and brutiſh fool-hardineſs of theſe men; for in doing thus, they are as a Ship that runs her ſelf upon a Rock; as a Moth that flyes at the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; they periſh every Mothers Child of them that thus ſteer their courſe. 4. See the high diſ-inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity that there is in this way of theirs: What do they herein, but ſpurn at the very bowels of their Heavenly Father? When God had found man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by his own voluntary defection, he might have left him as he did the fallen Angels, to have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever; but he was graciouſly reſolved not ſo to loſe his creature, but finds out a way how he might recover his creature (Man) again, in which certainly there are moſt admirable contrivances of Wiſdom, Power and Mercy; and he propoſeth terms of Reconciliation; he offers his Sons blood; bids the ſinner but come and humble himſelf, and ask pardon, and return to his Allegiance, and truſt in him for Pardon, Grace and Perſeverance to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life: No, ſaith the Legal ſelf-Juſtificiary, I have never ſinned, I have deſerved no anger, no diſpleaſure; I need no pardon, no mercy, I have no need of the blood of Chriſt: I ſay, all this, and a great deal more, which were not fit to be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, muſt lie as in the Seed, and in the Root, in a Legal Spirit, though perhaps it may never come di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to ſuch expreſſions, nor actual imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for let any one but imagine what would be the Language of a ſinner that ſeeks not Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith, Grace and Mercy, but by the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64817:63"/>Law, which can juſtifie none but for perfect and unerring obedience; and I think I may ſay, it can be no other but ſuch as I have mentioned, or fat worſe; it muſt be onely a deal of blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Grace of God, as uſeleſs and needleſs againſt the perſon of Chriſt as coming into the World to ſave ſinners, when there was no need o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet all this lies in a legal-Spirit, for which they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lie under a ſevere reproof from the foregoing aſſertions.

            </p>
            <p>But ſurely (may ſome ſay) there are no ſuch men as theſe you mention; there are none that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves perfectly holy; there are none but think they ſtand in need of pardon; we all cry God mercy for our ſins; and why ſhould you ſay that men are generally apt to do thus, to ſeek Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Works, and that moſt profeſſors run this way?</p>
            <p>I anſwer,

If there had not been ſuch a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men in the Apoſtles times, all the Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Argumentations of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> againſt this ſort of men, in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> had been uſeleſs: Now certainly the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did not trifle ſo with the world, as to ſet up Enemies in his own imagination, and then ſight with them: And yet it cannot be denyed by any, that the Apoſtle ſpends large Diſco rſes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentations againſt ſuch a ſort of men. Beſides, that the thing may be out of queſtion, that there were ſuch men, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> names them, points them out with the finger, lays hold of them, binds them down with ſuch Arguments, as they can never diſ-entangle themſelves from. He points them out; they were the <hi>Jews,</hi> they were the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and others; the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they may be ſaved; for I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge; for they being ignoram of Gods rightcouſneſs, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted to the right couſneſs of God.</hi> Here you ſee the Apoſtle draws up an high charge againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:64817:64"/>in the lump, and bulk, that is, the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> in general; it was a general miſtake of theirs, that they miſſed of God's righteouſneſs, that is, as I have explained it, the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith, and went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, that is, a righteouſneſs of works of the <hi>Law;</hi> they were ignorant of this, that Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs, as it is in ver. 4. of that chap. The <hi>Jews</hi> they would needs be juſtified by works; they are one ſort of men named by the Apoſtle, as guilty in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. But, which is yet ſtranger, not onely the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who were Gentiles, who had never received the Law, and lived under it, as the <hi>Jews</hi> had; had onely been educated in Heathen Idolatries and filthineſs, till the Goſpel came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; yet even theſe, after they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Goſpel, had begun in the Spirit, that is, in the way of Juſtification by Faith, in a Goſpel way, and had made publick Encomiums of the bleſſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate the Goſpel had brought them into, crying, <hi>O the bleſſedneſs!

Thus you have ſeen their Diſeaſe; now for further proof yet, that this was their diſtemper, we may obſerve, that the Apoſtle applies ſeveral arguments by way of remedy, which were proper onely for this diſtemper, in that one chap. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. I ſhall obſerve mine ſeveral Arguments ſive of which are contained in the firſt five verſes of that chap. and are more particular and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental for the conviction of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> the minor of every 'yllogiſm being evident in their experience; the major evident in its own nature, or from Scripture; the other four being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently convincing to every man, and of no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

Argument in the 2d. ver. Ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit by this plain preaching of Chriſt, which ye never did by your Law-Preachers: This, one would think, was a mighty Argument to them. <hi>This onely would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith.</hi> The Syllogiſm; They that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Spirit by the preaching of Faith, ſhould not for ſhame go off—But you have received—<hi>Ergo,</hi> 3d. Arg. in ver. 3. <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh, having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the fleſh?</hi> 'Tis a diſgrace for wiſe men to begin in any way, and alter their way at all before they make an end, but it is a higher diſgrace to begin in a better way, and end in a worſe; to begin in the Spirit, and to end in the Fleſh: As much as Spirit doth excel Fleſh (their Horſes are Fleſh, and not Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.3.) ſo much doth the Goſpel-way of <hi>Juſtification</hi> excel the <hi>Legal.</hi> The Syllogiſm is this They that have once begun in a more excellent way then the Law is, ſhould not go off to the Law; but you have begun in a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit: <hi>Ergo,</hi> 4th.

                  </gap> the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> The Law-Preachers could neither adminiſter the Spirit to their Hearers, nor yet work miracles in proof of what they delivered, both which the Apoſtle had done, and their preſent Miniſter <hi>Epaphrus</hi> did do; and yet they were ſo mad upon the Law, and the way of <hi>Juſtification by works,</hi> that they were ready to ſhake off the Goſpel for the inſupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Law. There are ye ſee at leaſt five Arguments in the compaſs of five verſes proper to them, and all five propoſed in the way of interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to expreſs the Apoſtles vehemency, his trouble at their deſection, his ſtrange admiration at it, his longing for their recovery, all which this interrogation-form implies. Then the Apoſtle proceeds to general and univerſal Arguments, not of ſuch particular concernment to them, ſuch as I have in my former Diſcourſe urged, <hi>viz.</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abraham</hi> from the 6. to the 10. from the nature of the Law, requiring ſtrict obedience, or elſe accurſing the ſinner, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. from an expreſs proof out of the Old-Teſtament, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. The juſt ſhall live by Faith, therefore not by the Law, (ſaith the Apoſtle) for the Law is not of Faith, 11, 12. And then comes in that great Argument which I have ſo largely inſiſted upon, That there was a Covenant of Grace on foot before ever the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which could not be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; therefore the Law came not in for a way of Juſtification, elſe it muſt have diſannulled this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, from the 15 to the 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:64817:66"/>I now recollect and argue, Here you ſee that not onely the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> deſired to be under the Law, would needs be juſtified by the works of the Law, elſe the Apoſtle had diſputed largely and ſtrenuouſly againſt no Enemy: Nay the <hi>Galatians,</hi> though they never had had the Law before, but onely firſt Heathen Idolatry, and then a pure Goſpel, and received it with joy and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and great intenſneſs of affection; received the Spirit through the Miniſtry of it, ſuffered much for the profeſſion of it; begun wel, and did run wel; yet, though they had begun in the Spirit, no ſooner came the Law-Preachers among them, but they turned from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had called them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, like fools, and men bewitched unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel, that is, unto a Law-Goſpel. The Law-Preachers no ſooner came amongſt the <hi>Galatians,</hi> but they turned the very Goſpel which the Apoſtle had preached and they received into ſo much Law, ſo that there ye might have ſeen Chriſtians to be the pure Diſciples of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nay far worſe then the true Seed were in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time. Now from hence I infer the firſt aſſertion in the coviction, <hi>viz.</hi> That there have been, and therefore may be ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men that (notwithſtanding the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> nay and the profeſſion of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> are legal in the buſineſs of Juſtification, followers of the Law, ſeek to be juſtified by works; and alſo, that we are very apt to run into this way without much care and caution: Who would ever thought that the <hi>Galatians</hi> that had ſo many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to engage them to keep in that way of Faith, ſhould ever have turned carnal and fleſhly in the buſineſs of Juſtification? Certainly this Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theirs argues a great aptitude in humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64817:67"/>to this way, unleſs you will think that the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> were of another make from all the men in the world.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add ſomewhat moreof proof to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and the parts of it, by and by; only I muſt firſt enter upon the explication of the 2d. thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Wherein this legality lyes, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the great iniſtake lies, that ſo many ſhould ſeek to be juſtified by a Covenant of Works, and yet acknowledge themſelves ſinners; and in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this, there will new proof ariſe to the firſt Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That men are generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the way of works.</p>

It is not a profeſſed put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves upon the Law of God ſtrictly, as it requires perfect, unerring obedience for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> durſt not adventure their ſouls; the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledged themſelves ſinners, though not ſuch ſinners as the Gentiles: We find when the <hi>Jews</hi> brought the Woman to Chriſt that was taken in Adultery, he ſet the Woman at liberty by this Sentence of ſtoning her; <hi>He that hath no ſin let him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the firſt ſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither did the <hi>Galatians</hi> aſſert themſelves free from ſins alas! they had been ſinners of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8. They had been Idolaters; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Apoſtle diſputes againſt them with ſuch arguments as took that <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> that they were ſinners, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Is many as are of the works of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64817:67"/>the Law, are under the curſe; for it is written, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> Now ſurely (as it might be ſupplyed) you will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have continued in all things; therefore you cannot expect to be juſtified by the works of the Law.</p>
            <p>Though I muſt needs ſay this, If they had gone wiſely to work in their ſeeking Juſtification by the Law, they muſt firſt have found themſelves free from ſin, hitherto of their lives, together with a power of keeping themſelves free for the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their lives, or elſe muſt have deſiſted in the beginning; and therefore the Apoſtle batters down their high imaginations of ſelf-righteouſneſs with ſuch arguments as theſe; The Law ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things;</hi> now you have not continued in all things: And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. when the Apoſtle had recited a Catalogue of ſins out of the Law, he infers, <hi>Now, we know that whatſoever things the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law (and ſo to you</hi> Jews <hi>eſpecially) that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God:</hi> As much as to have ſaid, As for all theſe ſins, ſome are found in one, and ſome in another; and where-ever any of them is found, there that man's mouth is ſtopped by the Law, and every ſuch perſon is become guilty or ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ect to the Judgement of God: 20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight, for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin;</hi> the Law tells you what is ſin, and ſo the wrath due to ſin; and by the Law every tranſgreſtion ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a juſt recompence of reward. And ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I teſtifie again to every man that is circumciſed,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:64817:68"/>(which was the uſual ſign of their going off to the Law) <hi>that he is a debtor to do the whole Law.</hi> And yet this you dare not undertake, O ye <hi>Galatians,</hi> this you dare not profeſs to do. A ſtrange Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they gave themſelves, that they would aim to be juſtified by the Law, and yet not hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to keep the whole Law! How could they ever think that the Law ſhould juſtifie them! and yet theſe arguments brought by the Apoſtle to convince them, both ſhew, that they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to anſwer the Law byunerring obedience, and fulfilling of it, as alſo that they ſhould have done thus, had they gone wiſely to work.</p>
            <p>So much for the firſt Propoſition, ſhewing what their way was not, yet ought to have been, had they underſtood themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet though they did not profeſs to appeal to a ſtrict Covenant of Works for Juſtification, and did not underſtand themſelves in what they did, yet by the way that the <hi>Jews</hi> &amp; <hi>Galatians</hi> took for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, they fell under that way of Works, &amp; were ſo reckoned by God to be, and by the Apoſtle in his Diſcourſes againſt them; elſe his Arguments had concluded nothing againſt them. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this, for that, though they did not formally intend a Covenant of Works, yet the way they took, was of that nature and tendency; and we have a diſtinction in the Schools, of <hi>ſinis Scientiae &amp; Scientis;</hi> now the <hi>ſinis Scientiae</hi> is eternal and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, as proceeding from the nature of the thing, let the <hi>finis Scientis</hi> be what it will; ſo if the way they took be legal, it is no matter whether they intended it or no. But you will ſay, What was that in their way, or what is that in this way which you ſay men uſually taken, which makes it ſo juſtly,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64817:68"/>and unavoidably be called and reckoned by God a putting our ſelves under a Covenant of Works, though we are not our ſelves aware of it? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the third and laſt place.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly,
<note place="margin">Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Legality conſiſts, poſitively.</note> It is ſuch a mixture of the Covenant of Works with the Covenant of Grace, as in which the Covenant of Works is predominant, and ſo moſt juſtly gives the denomination to their way; I fix upon the Word <hi>Predominant:</hi> For elſe (as I ſhal ſhew anon) all the Saints have ſome legal mixtures in their Spirits, even whilſt they treat God for their juſtification and acceptation; but becauſe they are byaſſed and ſwayed more by Evangelical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, then by Legal, they are after the Spirit, not after the Fleſh, in the buſineſs of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed in the firſt Propoſition, that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> did not profeſs themſelves perfectly holy, and ſo durſt not appeal to the Law in a ſtrict ſenſe for a righteouſneſs: I ſhall now further ſhew how in many things it appears that theſe Legalliſts, even whilſt ſuch, did profeſs and adhere to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is the way of Grace; and then, that yet by reaſon of their Legal mixtures, all their Goſpel was ſoured to them, and turned into ſo much Law; and they are no longer to be reckoned for Chriſtians, but the Diſciples of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2 3, 4. There are three proofs of this together, that they were great profeſſors of the Goſpel, when yet at the ſame time the Apoſtle diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as adhering to a Covenant of Works for Juſtification. Ver. 2. <hi>Behold, I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, That if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing:</hi> Here you ſee they thought to have had ſome profit and benefit by Chriſt: Now this was a great mixture of Goſpel in their way; for if hope

               </gap>inly is a mixture of the Goſpel with their Legal way, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If righteouſneſs come by the Law</hi> (as your way leads you to ſay) <hi>then Chriſt is dead in vain;</hi> but you will not allow that Chriſt died in vain; you hope for benefit from the death of Chriſt, notwithſtanding your cleaving to the Law for a righteouſneſs: Here was a great mixture you ſee of Goſpel with their way. And in the 3d. ver. of <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. we ſee they thought it was not their duty to keep the whole Law, but that I have ſpoken to already: in ver. 4. You may ſee yet the ſtrangeſt mixture of Goſpel in their way, which yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls Legal, that can be imagined; for they did profeſs themſelves (all this while they ſo cryed up the Law, were ſuch admirers of it, and Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to it) they did profeſs themſelves to be under Grace, to be in the way of Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Chriſt is become of none effect unto you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And according to this repreſentation which I have now given of Legal-perſons, that is, that they are more propending and inclining to the Law, then to the Goſpel, doth the Apoſtle be-ſpeak them, and ſpeak of them; he ſpeaks to them ſo in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Tell me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you that</hi> Deſire <hi>to be under the Law</hi> — They were ſuch, as though they durſt not quit the Goſpel, and come off wholly to the Law, yet had a <hi>deſire</hi> to be under the Law.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64817:70"/>their Juſtification: They that wil, after what I have ſaid, deny that there may be, or hath been ſuch a thing, ſuch perſons to be found that did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelves ſinners, and profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, and yet ſought to be juſtified by the works of the Law, let them quarrel with the Scriptures, and with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> if they dare, out of whom I have ſo clearly deſcribed them, and confute him if they can: Again, if any one queſtions that which I have aſſerted to be the manner how this comes to paſs, that theſe perſons are juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated and reputed Legal ſelf-Juſtificiaries, <hi>viz.</hi> by the predominancy of their inclination to the Law, more then to the Goſpel, let them ſhew a more probable way, and I ſhall gladly quit this</p>
            <p>Now the explication and proof of this matter being the very great thing of all ſhould not paſs without ſome improvement or obſervation from it, which I ſhall perform by and by; in the mean time, methinks a ſober perſon might very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be further ſatisfied in this great buſineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the explication of the nature of a Legal-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. I ſuppoſe it will be acknowledged, that that which gives denomination to a Legal-Spirit, is, his greater propenſion to the Law, then to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; but yet it may be queried: Wherein doth this propenſion exert and ſhew it ſelf? in what one word, or more then one, would you expreſs it? Now this I confeſs is the great difficulty; <hi>hic labor, hoc opus eſt;</hi> this were worthy of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Saint, and the moſt learned and accurate Head to diſcover; I can do it onely after my manner, that is, rawly enough; but would God I could provoke ſome able man to undertake it in the ſtrength of God.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64817:71"/>an Evangelical Spirit; though they have not been ſo happy in telling us wherein the difference lies; and for the difference which they make, the Legal way to lie in Doing, the Evangelical way in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, I confeſs it hath a great countenance from Scripture, as to the ſound of words; but, as they explain their ſenſe, I reckon there is a great diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement from the Scripture. As to their ſence of the word <hi>Believing,</hi> I ſhal have ſome occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin it anon; but as to the word <hi>Doing</hi> in their ſenſe, I ſay at preſent, That though the Scripture ſeems to expreſs the whole buſineſs of Legality in that word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4:4. <hi>Working</hi> or <hi>Doing;</hi> yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a far other ſenſe from their explication of it: For the Scripture in that place underſtands <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Doing</hi> in a ſtrict Law-ſenſe, ſo as to expect a Reward for it of Debt; whereas they will tel you, if you look upon Works as having any influence upon Juſtification, let the works be what they wil, you are ſo far Legal. Now having proved, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, their expoſition of <hi>Working</hi> or <hi>Doing</hi> to be but a falſe gloſs, I ſhall do my endeavour (and no more can be expected) to deliver the truth in this matter.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe therefore, according to that Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 4. where Legal Works or working are accurately deſcribed, that Legality lies in Doing any work with this ſuppoſition or conceit in my mind, <hi>that now I have juſtly obliged God,</hi> not only by a Juſtice of performing promiſe, but a Juſtice of ſtrict diſtribution according to the natural deſert of an action: My meaning is beſt expreſſed in that commonly known word of <hi>Merit;</hi> he that doth an action to God ſuppoſing that he hath now
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64817:72"/>merited a reward from God by diſtributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumtion of <hi>Merit,</hi> the form of Legality, is for that reward of Debt is the Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical note of a Legal Reward; therefore the expectation or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumtion of ſuch a reward ought to be in a Legal Spirit.</note> he is Legal in his action, and none other.</p>
            <p>It will bepreſently ſaid, Then there will not be found ſo many Legal profeſſors as you aſſert there are, for that few amongſt us, if any at all, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Merits.</hi> I anſwer, though they do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it with their mouths, yet this I ſuppoſe is the ſecret Language of their hearts, and where it is not, let them be free from the imputation of Legality for me; I ſee no rule to condemn them of it, though I wil add this. I think many men may diſown it in words, nay and think they are not guilty of it, that yet are extreamly guilty; ſuch a a ſecret unſearchable Diſeaſe of heart is this of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality.</p>
            <p>I have perfectly done with the explication or diſcovery of the Diſeaſe in its own nature; I ſhall come anon to give ſome ſymptomes of it, that are ſigns and effects of it; in the mean time let us ſee what improvement, what obſervations we can make upon that Anatomical Diſcovery which was made of the <hi>Galatians</hi> e'ne now.</p>

               </note> firſt of all, I ſhall obſerve the ſtrange and unhappy diſappointments that the Legal ſelf-Juſtitiaries meet with, the miſerable cheat that they put upon themſelves. They think to mix Law and Goſpel, they dare not ſtand to the Law alone; they would fain have a little help from the Goſpel to eke out their defects in a Legal Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64817:72"/>and alas! the Goſpel turns them off with ſcorn to the Law onely, to be tried and judged by it; which wil certainly condemn and devour them.</p>

               </note> I obſerve the ſtrange abſurdities and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradictions which theſe ſelf-Juſtitiaries, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentils,</hi> run into, in their proſecution of a Legal Righteouſneſs: There are no leſs then four contradictions which the <hi>Galatians</hi> ran into in this buſineſs: 1. They would be juſtified by the Law, and yet acknowledged themſelves ſinners, which is a contradiction; for it is obvious that the Law muſt condemn ſinners. 2. They would be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Law, and yet not be bound to do the whole Law; where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They would be juſtified by the Law, and yet have benefit by Chriſt and his death; whereas <hi>Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ras not the Miniſter of Circumciſion;</hi> Chriſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world and dyed, becauſe the Law was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and could not juſtifie. 4. See the greateſt of contradictions imaginable. They would be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied by the Law, and yet profeſs the Goſpel, and the way of Grace; therefore the Apoſtle convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them with this Argument, If ye ſeek Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the Law, <hi>ye are fallen from Grace,</hi> Rom. 11.6. <hi>If by Grace, then it is no more of works;</hi> yet all theſe abſurdities and contradictions the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſwallowed, that they might go on with their way of Works, which they were ſo greedy after, and addicted to, beſides all thoſe evident arguments, both general, and of more particular concernment to them, which they went againſt; though they had received the Spirit by the Goſpel; though miracles
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64817:73"/>were done amongſt them in confirmation of the Goſpel, neither of which attended the Law; though they had done and ſuffered ſo many things for the Goſpel, yet all of a ſudden, like men bewitched, away they turn to the Law, and in effect, though not in profeſſion, they leave the Goſpel. From whence again I add new proof, as I promiſed to the firſt thing propoſed in the conviction, which is my third obſervation.</p>
            <p>Therefore certainly mankind is exceedingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to this way of works,
<note n="3" place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſer.</hi>
               </note> though not in a-ſtrict way, yet in this mixt way, which comes all to one at laſt, and muſt be called by the ſame Name I ſay I may juſtly infer from this one example of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> That mankind is exceedingly addicted unto this way of works.</p>
            <p>For though an argument <hi>ab exemplo</hi> be not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily cogent, yet ſuch an example as this wil of it ſelf almoſt amount to a demonſtration; for it is not an example of one man, but of a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men; they were the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> as it is in chap. 1. ver. 2. and <hi>Galaria</hi> was not a Town or a City, but a large Countrey that had many Churches up and down in it; and theſe were ſuch as had gladly received the Goſpel, they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> as if he had been an Angel of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus; they bleſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exceedingly in this, that they had heard the Goſpel from him, they received the Spirit by it. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now notwithſtanding all this, no ſooner do a company of Law-Preachers come that could do no Miracles at all, could not convey the Spirit in their Miniſtry, and yet the <hi>Galatians</hi> are ſo bewitched, and beſotted with them, through their own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclinations to a Legal Righteouſneſs, that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64817:73"/>they fall off to the Law in the ſight and view of all thoſe demonſtrations and convictions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and ſwallow down four ſeveral contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to boot; <hi>Ergo,</hi> hence it evidently appears, that men are exceeding apt to run into this way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Works; unleſs we ſhall imagine, that this inclination in whole Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> was ſome ſtrange kind of ſpecial diſtemper, ariſing from the ſoyle or ſome ſuch trifling cauſe that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it from being common to us with them: I ſay, I take it for proved and granted from this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is to me much like an Induction; the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Churches of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> that were Gentiles, were wholly given to this way; therefore this way is mighty natural to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and we have all a ſtrong propenſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to it; but here comes in one conſiderable objection, upon the anſwering of which, the truth of this laſt Aſſertion wil be much clearer, and that is this:</p>
            <p>You ſay,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> that becauſe the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> and the Gentile-<hi>Galatians</hi> were ſo much addicted to the way of Juſtification of Works, therefore it is an argument, that all mankind is addicted to this way, and that we are in danger of running into this way; but you do not ſeem to obſerve the great ſnare and ſtumbling-block that lay in their way, to put them upon it, and that was the Ceremonial Law, which they did not underſtand as typical of Chriſt and Goſpel-Myſteries, but looked upon it as a task of duties, which if they did go thorow, and do their beſt to keepe, they ſhould undoubtedly pleaſe God, and be ſaved: Now this Ceremonial Law was given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not perfectly out of uſe when the <hi>Galatians</hi> were thus led aſide by it;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64817:74"/>but was preached up by the devout <hi>Jews</hi> that were turned to Chriſtianity, that if they were not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and kept not the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not be ſaved, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1. Now this the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> receiving as true, and holding the Goſpel with it, they did with the <hi>Jews</hi> too much dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ceremonial Obſervances; and ſo their Goſpel which they profeſſed with it, was ſowred and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by it; but we are not in this danger; we know that the Ceremonial Law is down, and ſo we are free from this ſnare and danger; therefore we need not fear leſt we run into a Covenant of Works, or ſeek Juſtification by works. This is the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and you ſee it is conſiderable, to which I ſhall endeavour an anſwer.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all I anſwer by way of conceſſion in three particulars.
<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 1. 'Tis true, the <hi>Jews,</hi> had the Ceremonial Law impoſed upon them by God, and the <hi>Galatians</hi> by the ſeduction of falſe Teachers, received it likewiſe as their duty. 2. The Ceremonial Law was apt to prove a ſnare to all that were under it, in leading them into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works: For to be ſet to do a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which we underſtand no meaning almoſt in, how naturally will it teach us to take up with the <hi>opus operatum</hi> the work done, &amp; to look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Which eaſily miſ-leads us into an opinion of Merit, eſpecially when we think our ſelves prettily well to have diſcharged our ſelves of the duties of the Moral Law beſides. 3. Let it be granted that this did actually prove a great ſnare both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> which appears from this, that the Apoſtle when he is rebuking the <hi>Galatians</hi> for their Legality, he inſtanceth for proofs often in their obſerving the Ceremonial Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8, 9.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64817:74"/>
               <hi>I winder</hi> (ſaith he) that after ye were <hi>ſet free from bondage</hi> to Idols by the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhould deſire again to enter into bondage</hi> to ceremonies, which there he calls <hi>beggarly rudiments;</hi> and in ver. 10, 11. ſaith he, <hi>Ye obſerve dayes, and months, and times, and years; I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed upon you labour in vain:</hi> Nay, the Apoſtle inſtanceth ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the buſineſs of the Ceremonial Law, that an incurious Reader might think that all thrir fault was but this, that they made Conſcience of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ceremonial Law; though 'tis certain, and I have proved it already, that this was not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fault they had fallen into; for then the Apoſtle would onely have gone about to convince them, that the Ceremonial Law was aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, or at leaſt that they being Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, need not have their Conſciences obliged to it; which doth not ſcarce at all appear to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of his deſign; <hi>but his main deſign is to beat them off from a Covenant of works, unto which the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law ſerved for an Inlet.</hi> And indeed this was the nature and genius of their miſchievous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; they thought, as the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo did, that though they were not ſo ſtrict as they ſhould be in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the great &amp; weighty duties of the Moral Law, yet if they were ſtrict and careful in obſerving the Ceremonial, this would make ſome amends for their other great defects; and herein we ſee the Ceremonial Law proved a great ſnare. Thus our Saviour chargeth the <hi>Jews,</hi> even whileſt it was their duty to keep the ceremonial Law, that they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the obſervances of the ceremonial Law in the room of their obedience to the moral Law; <hi>Ye pay tythe of Mint, and Anniſe, and Cummin, and have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the weightier matters of the Law, Judgement,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64817:75"/>Mercy and Faith; theſe ought ye to have done, and notto leave the other undone,</hi> Matth. 23.23. and ſo in <hi>Iſa</hi> 1. chap. ver. 10. And this I think is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Divines to have been the error of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galatians.</hi> Now let theſe three things be granted; yet in the 4th. place by way of direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the objection: Though the Ceremonial L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w were apt to prove a Snare, and actually did prove a Snare to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> yet it was their natural inclination to Legality, to a Legal way of treating with God for their Juſtification and acceptation, that betrayed them into this Snare, or that made it prove ſuch a Snare to them: For elſe the Ceremonial Law was, in its true uſe, and in the deſign of the Lord when he firſt gave it, a great bleſſing unto the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it was a part of that Diſpenſation which is called their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and their glory in the ſight of the Nations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6. I ſay, the Ceremonial Law was not in its own nature unavoidably ſuch a ſnare as would lead them to a Covenant of Works, nor in the deſign of God who gave it; nay it was deſigned to be to them a ſigurative Goſpel; and therefore, though it was ſomewhat capable of being made uſe of to ſuch an end, to ſerve the turn and humor of a Legal Spirit, yet none but thoſe that were ſo addicted, could have made ſuch a perverſe and deſtructive uſe of it, or, if it had been unavoidably, I ſay, make the ſuppoſition that it had been unavoidably ſuch a dangerous ſnare to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law given them from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> yet the Gentile-<hi>Galatians</hi> had not ſuch a temptation to receive it, with that veneration that the <hi>Jews</hi> had; and having received the Goſpel before, and ſtil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the profeſſion of it, might have been well
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64817:75"/>antidoted againſt the danger of it; and yet they receive it ſuddenly in this noxious and miſchievous uſe of it: And for what reaſon can we imagine all this to have come to paſs, but becauſe they were naturally diſpoſed, and exceeding apt to catch at any occaſion of ſerving God, <hi>as it were</hi> by the works of the Law, or according to a Covenant of Works. 5thly, I ſay therefore, that though we have not the Ceremonial Law of the <hi>Jews</hi> to prove a Snare to us, yet we have this radicated inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Covenant of Works which betrayed the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> by occaſion of the Ceremonial Law, into the proſecution of Juſtification by Works; and this I think was formerly evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the example of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> as by an induction. 6thly, As for the ceremonial Law, perhaps it would be granted, that if we had ſuch reaſon to receive it as the <hi>Jews</hi> had before Chriſt, when it was their duty to obſerve it, or but ſuch a ſeeming reaſon as the <hi>Galatians</hi> after their ſeduction thought they had; perhaps it would be granted, that if the caſe were ſo with us as it was with either of them, that then we ſhould be in great danger to do as they did, and to vent that natural Legality, or addictedneſs to the way of works, which hath been evinced to be in all men, in ceremonial obſervances: Now let but ſo much be granted, and then I have this to offer, That though we are free from the ceremonial Law of the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp; know it abrogated by Chriſt's death, yet we may ſtil have a like danger, though not the ſame; nay, the Chriſtian Church hath for many hundreds of years (I ſhall not meddle with the preſent ſtate of things) I ſay, the Chriſtian Church hath for many hundreds of years together formerly, been under
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64817:76"/>as great a danger from ceremonies, as the <hi>Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> were in from the ceremonial Law; and for proof of this, I ſhal onely quote ſome paſſages out of the preface to the Book of Common-Prayer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title, <hi>Of Ceremonies, why ſome be aboliſhed, and ſome retained;</hi> where you have theſe, beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſions: <hi>Some Ceremonies are put away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the great exceſs and multitude of them hath ſo encreaſed in theſe later days, that the burthen of them was intollerable; whereof St.</hi> Auſtine <hi>in his time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that they were grown to ſuch a number, that the eſtate of Chriſtian people was in worſe caſe concerning that matter, then were the Jews; and he counſelled that ſuch yoke and burthen ſhould be taken away, as time would ſerve quietly to do it. But what would St.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine <hi>have ſaid, if he had ſeen the Ceremonies of late dayes uſed amongſt us, whereunto the multitude uſed in his time was not to be compared? This our exceſſive multitude of Ceremonies was ſo great, and many of them ſo dark, that they did more confound and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, then declare and ſet forth Chriſts benefits unto us.</hi> There are other conſiderable paſſages concerning ceremonies in that Preface; but this that I have tranſcribed, ſerves ſufficiently for my purpoſe, and I ſuppoſe fully takes off the objection, that ſince the ceremonial Law is down, Chriſtians cannot be in the ſame danger that the <hi>Jews</hi> &amp; <hi>Galatians</hi> were from ceremonies. I have yet one more particular to add by way of anſwer to the objection, and it is this in the ſeventh place.

               <hi>Galatians,</hi> and we all have ſuch an inclination to, ſuch an earneſt deſire after the way of Works, that without a ſtrict hand over our ſelves from giving way to this natural diſpoſition, we ſhould be all exceeding apt to find out ſome way or other of venting this humour, either by inventing ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſuperiſttions, or doing the duties of the Moral Law ſuperficially, and yet reſting upon them for our Juſtification: As for duties or good works that are truly good, though they may be abuſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their performance by a ſpiritual pride adhering to them; nay, though they may perhaps be ſpoiled ſometimes by an opinion of merit, yet becauſe I cannot think it poſſible for a man that doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelf to ſerve God with a perfect heart, to turn all his really-good Works into Legal-Works, by an opinion of Merit; I ſhal except this from being a third way in which Legality predominant may exert and ſhew it ſelf. But for the other two ways of invented ceremonies, or ſuperſtitiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances, and an external obedience to the duties of the Moral Law, I think the nature of man is ſo addicted to the way of Works, that though there were no ceremonial Law amongſt us at preſent, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God or men; yet men would generally find out one or both of thoſe ways to vent their Legality, even to an opinion of merit in them. This I ſhal ſhew to have been uſually practiſed in the times of the Scripture, and ſince, and in our own time; that is, that ceremonies or external ſervices, not commanded in the moral Law, were invented even whileſt there was a ceremonial Law in force, and vaſt numbers ſince its abolition, and both reſted upon; as alſo, that a ſuperficial perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Moral Duties is found both in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64817:77"/>and in our own experience to have been reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon. For the latter firſt; How common wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it with the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time to think, that if they kept the Letter of the Law, they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their duty contained in that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! If they did not kill a man, they thought they diſcharged their duty in the ſixth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If they did not commit Adultery, they had diſcharged the ſeventh; and ſo having kept the Law, they might expect the Law ſhould juſtifie them; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> whilſt a Phariſee, he was touching the Law blameleſs, as he thought, which if he had truly been, and continued ſo, he might well have expected to be juſtified by it: And ſo the young Phariſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.20 ſays of the Commandments, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth:</hi> And upon this he reſted hitherto. I have heard one my ſelf whom I judged a wicked man, and ſo did many others beſides me; yet ſayes he, <hi>Well, I am confident if any Family in ſuch a place have the bleſsing of God, ours hath; for we have prayers mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening, and never a croſs or angry word paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth between me and my wife from one end of the week to the other.</hi> This imperfect obedience to the Moral Law, he made the matter of his Juſtification, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps even to an explicite opinion of Merit. Thus you ſee men that have any conformity to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Law, are apt to place their truſt there: But now becauſe there are few ſo ſtrict as St. <hi>Paul</hi> whileſt a a Phariſee was, or as the young man was; but that there is a conſciouſneſs of guilt from the Moral Law, therefore they are the leweſt Legalliſts that reſt upon their obedience to the Moral Law alone, if any do; they muſt help patch up their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with ceremonial obſervances, ſo that the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64817:77"/>Law (whether given by God, or invented by men) hath moſt cuſtom, and bears up the weight of theſe mens expectations; and I think I may make this aſſertion, (at leaſt this gueſs) that there were never any in the world that ſought Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by works, but they were much in love with ſome ſuperſtitlons, or at leaſt with Ceremonies; yea, even thoſe who have been moſt ſtrict in obſerving the duties of the Moral Law, as to the Letter of it; yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r greateſt Phariſees, they are as much for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervation of Ceremonies as any men in the world. How were the Phariſees in our Saviours time addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to invented ceremonies and ſuperſtitions, though one would think they had enough cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in their Law already?

            <p>Wicked men, and thoſe that are careleſs in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moral Law, are for ceremonies to patch up a righteouſneſs; Phariſees are for them to have a redundancy of righteouſneſs, ſuch as may make ſure work, yea ſuch as may ſerve themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too; and this cannot well be but by ſuch Works as were not their duty to do, and ſo muſt be inventions of their own; ſo that, however it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſs one way or another, both the ſtrict Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiſt, and looſer ſelf-Juſtitiaries, lay the chief ſtreſs in pleaſing God, and ſeeking his favour upon ceremonious obſervances.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64817:78"/>in any man's Judgement. Any thing but believing. But it is better to hear the Lord to declare himſelf what he is pleaſed with, than go by our own fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh gueſſes; and therefore ſee the 8. ver. of <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. and the Lord tells us what it is; nay the Lord tells us that we know our ſelves what it is, if we would but conſult our own hearts, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee, but to do Juſtice, and to ſhew Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Alas! God doth not require all this operous, laborious, and coſtly ſervice which men are apt to put themſelves upon. He loves nothing but truth in the inward parts. Serve God honeſtly, truſt in him, love thy neighbour, do Juſtice, ſhew mercy, and this is better then all whole burnt-offerings and ſacrifices, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.33. And this I ſhall ſhew anon (as I have partly already in the expoſition of that <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11.) is believing, that is, it contains the great myſtery of believing in it. Not that I have ſo little of a Schollar, as to ſay or think, that ſhewing mercy is believing; or doing juſtly is believing, except in a figurative ſenſe, as we put the Name of the cauſe upon the effect, or the Name of the chief ingredient upon the whole compoſition. We muſt not ſo miſcall things, leſt at laſt we have no Names left us to call things by; but I ſay, herein is contained the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the way of believing, in oppoſition to the way of Works. But to return, What a brave flouriſh doth <hi>Micah</hi>'s man make with his legal Righteouſneſs? What high promiſes? What vaſt offers doth he make? thouſands of Rams, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rivers of Oyle, more then ever any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in the world could ſet on running! Yet theſe mighty offers doth this man here make to the Lord
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64817:79"/>for his favour, in the mean time he miſſeth paſſeth by this poor contemptible way of believing. Only believe, believe and all things are poſſible. Do juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God. No, but men that wil merit heaven; they muſt be doing ſuch a number of Duties, ſo many <hi>Ave-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> ſo many <hi>Pater-noſters,</hi> Heatheniſh, vain repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; they muſt give themſelves ſo many ſtripes of a <hi>Good-Friday.</hi> Surely they think God ſlights plain honeſty as an homely thing, and that he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with gallant, gandy, magnificent ſervices, or elſe with barbarous cruelties and ſeverities.</p>
            <p>Thus I reckon I have in ſome ſort proved my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and laſt aſſertion in anſwer to the objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That men are ſo far addicted to the way of works, that though they had no ceremonial Law at all, yet they would be finding out ſome way or other to vent this humour, either in ſuperficial o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Moral law, or in full tasks of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious obſervances which they could invent for themſelves. The Heathens did it in barbarous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and vain repetitions; the Phariſees in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers waſhings, and that <hi>Jew</hi> in <hi>Micah,</hi> in coſtly and diabolical offerings; ſo that though we are freed from the Ceremonial law of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſhould be freed altogether from the Ceremonies in the Chriſtian Church, yet we are not quite out of all danger of ſeeking Juſtification by works. All now that I can apprehend my ſelf any way engaged to ſpeak unto further, upon the ſecond particular in the conviction, by way of diſcovery wherein this legality ſhould lye, is, That ſeeing I have aſſerted that it muſt conſiſt onely in opinion of Merit; I ſhould ſpeak a little to prove that there is ſuch a thing as that commonly in practiſe in the world of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64817:79"/>which I ſhall give a brief proof both in <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> which will yet further evince, that we are not wholly free from the danger; and then I ſhall come to give ſome marks and ſigns of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal-ſpirit. That there was ſuch a thing among the <hi>Jews,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Smith</hi> a late Writer, in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Diſcourſes, hath taken very good pains to prove. In that Diſcourſe which treats of a Legal and Evangelical Righteouſneſs, he tells us, That it was a great affirmation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, <hi>That happineſs by way of Merit, is far greater and much more magnificent then that which is by way of Mercy; and ſo that they reckoned</hi> (they are his own words) <hi>upon a more triumphant and illuſtrious kind of happineſs, victoriouſly to be atchieved by the merit of their own works, then that beggarly kind of happineſs (as they ſeem to look, upon it) which cometh like an Alms from Divine bounty. And accordingly they held</hi> (I ſhal give you the Authors words) <hi>That the Law deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them upon</hi> Mount Sinai, <hi>was a ſufficient Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from God, and</hi> ALL THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE BY HIM <hi>for the advancing of them to a ſtate of perfection and bleſſedneſs; and that the proper end and ſcope of their Law was nothing but to afford them ſeveral wayes and means of merit.</hi> But yet ſee what their great brags of Merit came to! See what ſtrange Diſpenſations they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! even ſuch as the <hi>Galatians</hi> gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whilſt they ſought to be juſtified by works; for the ſame Author in the third Chapter of the Diſcourſe mentioned, quotes this paſſage out of the <hi>Miſna, Lib. Maccoth. Sect. ult.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the meaning whereof is, <hi>That therefore the Precepts of the Law were ſo many in number, that ſo they might ſingle out where they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64817:80"/>and in exerciſing themſelves therein, procure Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; or as</hi> Obadias de Bartenora <hi>expounds it, that whoſoever ſhall perform any one of the</hi> 613. <hi>Precepts of the Law (for ſo many they make in number; without any worldly reſpect for love of the Precept, behold, this man ſhall merit thereby everlaſting life.</hi> Here they might have been convinced by thoſe two Arguments which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth againſt the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things.</hi> And <hi>he that is circumciſed,</hi> that is, profeſſeth to be juſtified by the Law, <hi>is a debtor to keep the WHOLE</hi> Law. And this we find the Phariſees to do in our Saviours time, &amp; they taught, that if a man had devoted what he ſhould have given his Parents, to God, he was diſpenſed with from the duty of the fifth Commandment to Father and Mother; he might ſay it was <hi>corban,</hi> that is, a gift already given to God, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.5. So that they taught their Diſciples to pick and chuſe among the Commandments, which they would do, and which they would leave undone; nay, to leave out ſome of the greateſt commands of all, that they might but fulfil ſome one of their inventions. Here you have ſeen the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of mankind in the buſineſs of Merit, inſtanced in the <hi>Jews;</hi> they liked the way of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit rather then the way of Mercy, and yet cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with this, That if they kept any one Law of the 613. (that is, if they kept it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, as the ſame Author tells us) they ſhould merit everlaſting life. And that there is ſuch a thing as opinion of Merit in their ſerving of God at this day amongſt men profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, we may know eaſily, if we hear but what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> teach, and hold, and practiſe;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64817:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>they won the very word Merit, that good works are meritorious: And, if they ſeem to avoid the thing which we mean, by their diſtinction of <hi>Meritum excongruo, &amp; condigno,</hi> yet we will eaſily faſten the Thing upon them. For Merit, as I have ſaid, in the Scripture-notion of it, is when a man that doth any action to God, expects the Reward of Debt, and ſo demands it at the hands of the Law: Now theſe men profeſs that they can do more then the Law requires of them; they can lay up a ſtock of good Works that ſhal ſerve for others, which the Church may diſpoſe of to thoſe that want them, and they ſhall be meritorious for them; therefore it muſt follow that they have done what the Law requires; for how can he do works of ſupererogation, which were not demanded of him by the Law, and which the Church may diſpoſe of at pleaſure, who hath not kept the whole Law? There is ſuch a thing as opinion of Merit amongſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their ſerving of God; therefore we may be guilty of it: How doth the Pope tell them, and they believe it, that if they do ſuch and ſuch things, which are not made the condition of pardon by God, for going ſuch a pilgrimage, for taking ſuch a penance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhall have their ſins pardoned for ſo long a time? And wherein doth Juſtification conſiſt ſo much as in pardon of ſin? Therefore they ſeek Juſtification by Works, even by inventions of their own, which is worſe then by Works commanded. Now that which is ſo groſs amongſt them, may be as truly though more refinedly amongſt our ſelves. I have now done with the two firſt particulars in the Conviction. I ſhall onely now recollect what I have ſaid and proved, that ſo I may borrow ſome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64817:81"/>ſtrength for what follows, and ſo proceed.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo then, that all mankind is ſo exceeding apt to ſeek Juſtification by Works? And is it ſuch an hidden and unſearchable evil of heart, that we cannot eaſily know it, it hath ſo many ſelf-deceits, and runs through ſo many contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Doth it lie in opinion of Merit, &amp; yet is Merit ſo generally diſowned, and yet ſo many real votaries to it? What need then have we to ſearch, and try if we are not guilty in this particular, and how far we may poſſibly be guilty? For, though we have found out the very notion in which it muſt lie, <hi>viz.</hi> The Opinion of <hi>Merit;</hi> yet this will not ſerve uſually to find it out by; for who of us doth not renounce <hi>Merits,</hi> and yet who of us (if the foregoing aſſertions be true) is not addicted to Legality? I ſhall come therefore to ſome other ways of diſcovery of this evil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of heart; ſome marks and ſigns of it, ſome effects which diſcover their cauſe, though never ſo occult and hidden before. And this is the third particular in the Conviction which I promiſed: The firſt was to diſcover, that there are ſuch men as ſeek Juſtification by Works. The ſecond was to diſcover wherein their Legality lies: And this third to diſcover by ſome ſigns where this Legality is to be found, either in a predominancy, or in any leſs degree.</p>
            <p>Now for the diſcharge of this laſt part of my Work in the Conviction;
<note place="margin">The third thing in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, <hi>viz.</hi> the Characters</note> I ſhall firſt premiſe two things, and then come to the Characters. The firſt is this, That all men in the world are either prophane and Atheiſtical; or elſe in ſome way or other Religious; as for thoſe that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and atheiſtical, I have nothing to do with them in this Diſcourſe, for that they have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64817:81"/>nothing to do with Juſtification, who make no purſuit after it at all. The ſecond obſervation that I would premiſe, is this. That as for the Religious World, thoſe that treat with God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any ſort for their ſalvation, they are all redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to one of theſe two ſorts; they are either Legal or Evangelical in their ſervice and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for there being but two wayes of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either in the Scripture, or imaginable by us by unerring obedience and meriting, or by the way of mercy, which accepts an humble ſincerity; I ſay, there being onely theſe two ways, all that ſeek Juſtification muſt be of one of theſe two ways; and hence I would infer, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we find in Scripture any two ways of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, that have followers and abettors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two oppoſite ways, whereof one is good and acceptable, the other evil and diſpleaſing to God, there are theſe two ways of Legal and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical ſervice; and the Characters of the good way may be referred to the head of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, the Characters of the bad unto the head of Legal Worſhippers: Or if we cannot make a clear reference of every miſcarriage in Religion unto legallity, yet this I dare affirm, and ſhall prove, That the diſtinction of Legal and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Worſhippers, or of ſuch as are fleſhly, and ſuch as are ſpiritual in the Worſhip of God, is very ancient; nay as ancient as all Antiquity; ſo that throughout all ages in the Scripture, and in our own age in undeniable experience, there may be traced theſe two ſorts of religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that by Characters that are viſibly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galor Evangelical. And whatever be the infinite perty differences of Sects in any age or place, yet all men profeſſing Religion, may be reduced
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64817:82"/>to theſe two claſſes or ſorts of Legal and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Worſhippers; and theſe are the great things that are to be minded in them; if you find that they are ſpiritual Worſhippers, paſs by their petty differences; if they are fleſhly, be not deceived by that fair ſhew which they make in the fleſh; for the Antiquity and continual ſuceeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe two ſorts of Worſhippers, and that as they include all ſorts of Religious perſons, ſee one Scripture, &amp; then I come to the Characters; it is in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. <hi>But as then,</hi> that is, in <hi>Abraham's time, he</hi> of the one ſide <hi>that was born after the fleſh,</hi> the ſon of the Bond-woman <hi>Hagar,</hi> the Son of a Covenant of Works, <hi>perſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it were proper to enlarge upon this obſervation, I could give more ample proof of it.</p>

I ſay, thoſe that are under predominant Legality in treating with God for their juſtification and acceptation, they are chiefly for external ſervices in their Worſhip, and expreſſions of their obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.

By the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is uſually underſtood the Circumciſion, or legal <hi>Jew,</hi> that gloryed in his Circumciſion, here called the Conciſion, by an Ironical <hi>Paronomaſia,</hi> alluding to the Factions and Schiſms which they made every where; Beware of theſe (ſaith the Apoſtle) and do not receive them, nor adher to them; <hi>for we are the Circumciſion,</hi> that is, the true Children of <hi>Abraham which worſhip God in the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT,</hi> in a true <hi>SPIRITUAL</hi> way of Worſhip, <hi>and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no conſidence in the fleſh,</hi> which they, the legal Worſhippers have; they are <hi>fieſhly,</hi> we are <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in the Spirit. <hi>They</hi> have <hi>conſidence in the fleſh,</hi> we have none. Now what is this confidence in the fleſh, which the Conciſion, the Dogs and evil Workers had, but the true Worſhippers had not: This the Apoſtle explains at large in the 4, 5, and 6. verſes. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might TRUST in the FLESH, I more.</hi> What is that of the Fleſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might glory if he would?

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64817:83"/>the matter of fleſhly glorying or boaſting, which you ſee is made up either of external Rites and Priviledges, or the external obedience to the moral law.</p>
            <p>That which he calls fleſh, is an external thing. Now that fleſhly and legal are <hi>Synonymous,</hi> or words importing the ſame thing, and ſo uſed by the Apoſtle, is not onely clear in this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in other Scriptures; for inſtance <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh, having begun in the Spirit,</hi> that is, a Goſpel-way, <hi>are ye now made perfect by the fleſh?</hi> that is, will ye end in a legal, that is, a fleſhly way? Fleſhly and Legal are all one: Now the way of the Fleſh is an external way, made up of outward Rites, Ceremonies, Priviledges and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; therefore a legal way is a way in which men pleaſe themſelves with external Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Performances.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed before, that thoſe that are addicted to the way of works, durſt not pretend to an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal conformity to the law in a ſtrict ſenſe of it, and yet do ſeek to be juſtified by Works; therefore they muſt have ſome Works to glory in, and to uphold their Spirits in a confidence of Divine acceptance: Now therefore what can theſe Works be, other then external confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to the ceremonial or moral law, and theſe ceremonies either as given by God, or elſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtiouſly invented by themſelves? I ſhall now a little further exemplifie what I then aſſerted, and that by ſome aſſiſtance from the ſecond thing premiſed, in ſhewing that in all times the evil ſort of Worſhippers (which becauſe they are not Evangelical, muſt be legal) have done, and do exceedingly pleaſe themſelves in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64817:83"/>Priviledges and Performances, in doing which I ſhall avoid uſeleſs repetitions.</p>
            <p>We find,
<note place="margin">The firſt external priviledge which the <hi>Iews</hi> glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</note> that the <hi>Jews</hi> who were as well to be condemned for Legality before the dayes of the Goſpel, as under it, (there having been always a fleſhly and ſpiritual Seed) were exceedingly taken with their being circumciſed, and of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and made a peculiar people to God in the Lump and Body of the Nation, which did not hinder at all, but for particular perſons they might be wicked enough, ſtrangers to God, and heirs of wrath. Thus the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Jews,</hi> ſcorned the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> called them Dogs, and the ſinners of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or Nations; whereas to be <hi>Jews</hi> born, was nothing but an external Priviledge. And therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, when he comes to convince them of this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vain fleſhly boaſting, he makes no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do but to cut them off from this ſtump that they ſtood upon, by that great diſtinction ſo frequent in his Epiſtles, of <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh, and the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the true Seed according to the Promiſe, that is, Believers: <hi>All are not Iſrael that are of Iſrael,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and he is not a Jew that is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Circumciſion is that of the heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God, Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29.

            <p>And the <hi>Gal.</hi> we find were come to this, Gal. 3.10. <hi>Ye obſerve days, and months, &amp; times, and years,</hi> that is, Jewiſh Feaſts; <hi>I am afraid of you, leſt I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon you labour in vain:</hi> When they once came to obſerve them, there was a great deal of danger, and cauſe for the Apoſtles ſear, that they would reſt in the obſervance of them, for that this was the reaſon why they took to obſerving of them (when it was not now any longer the <hi>Jews</hi> duty ſo much as to obſerve them) becauſe of their inclination to a Covenant of Works, which chiefly expreſſeth it ſelf in an external ſervice.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> (amongſt whom the ſame peſtilent Law-Preachers had been) they were enſnared to the making conſcience of dayes, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths and new Moons, and alſo in the buſineſs of meats, that ſome were clean, and others unclean, which was once the <hi>Jews</hi> duty to obſerve; inſomuch that <hi>Peter</hi> tells the Lord, he had been ſo ſtrict in the buſineſs hitherto, that <hi>nothing common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi> (meaning of the fleſh of unclean Beaſts and Fowls) <hi>had entred into his mouth, Acts</hi> 11.6.8. But now was not only not their duty any longer, but at leaſt to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> a ſin to make any conſcience in it; for that they could hardly begin ſuch a thing, at ſuch a time, upon the inticement of falſe Teachers (for none elſe perſwaded the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to it) but from an evil inclination of ſwerving from the pure Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel which they had received from the Apoſtles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Covenant of Works, thus ſerved out to them by their falſe Teachers. And it argues almoſt as ill
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64817:87"/>a diſpoſition in the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians</hi> but to take up theſe things as their duty, as it did in the <hi>Jews</hi> to place ſo much in them when they were their duty; <hi>Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of the new. Moon, or of the Sabbath-dayes, which are a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2.14, 16, 17. Theſe things when they were in uſe, and were mens du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were at beſt but ſhadows; and yet theſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows did men exceedingly glory in, and preferred them before true holineſs, and the ſpiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; yea they thought verily, that whileſt they did obſerve theſe things, they might commit all manner of Villanies, and yet eſcape the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: Yea, they thought they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to do all ſorts of abominations, as it is in <hi>Jer,</hi> 7.10.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle finds out ſuch a generation of <hi>Jews</hi> in his time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. from the 17. to the 25. <hi>Behold thon art called a Jew, and reſteſt in the Law</hi> (a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, I think, of one that ſeeks Juſtification by the Law) <hi>and makeſt thy boaſt of God, and knoweſt his will:</hi> And the Apoſtle proceeds to deſcribe a great Lawyer indeed, one that thought himſelf ſit to be <hi>a Guide of the blind, a Light of them that walk in darkneſs, an inſtructer of the fooliſh, a teacher of babes, and one that had the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the Law.</hi> Yet what kind of man is he for his Morals? Why he is a Thief, an Adulterer, a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious perſon, what not? ver 21, 22. <hi>Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf? thou that preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal? Thou that ſayeſt a man ſhould not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, doſt thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacriledge?</hi> Yet this man hopes
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64817:87"/>to be ſaved by the Law; for it is ſaid, <hi>He took up his reſt in the Law, he reſted in the Law, and made his boaſt of God.</hi> Where then muſt he center his hopes? and upon what can he ground his boaſting, but upon ſome ceremonial performances? Therefore one that ſeekes Juſtification by the Law, may, and it is often found that they do practiſe it only in ſome ceremonious obſervances. I ſhall give onely one proof more of this, and ſo haſten on to what follows; and it ſhall be of the Lawyers, Scribes and Phariſees in our Saviour's time, who were the great boaſters of the Law, and expected Juſtification by the righteouſneſs of it. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, that they were much for Tything of <hi>Mint, Anniſe</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> thoſe leſſer things of the Law: I ſhall add more of our Saviours obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon them, Matth. 23.5. <hi>That they made broad their Phylacteries, and enlarged the borders of their Garments:</hi> Of which, ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> the firſt, <hi>to wit,</hi> Phylacteries, was an invention of their own wholly, together with a multitude of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ceremonies. The ſecond indeed, that of Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, preſcribed by God, but yet both abuſed by them to a vain glorying and boaſting; <hi>They waſhed the out-ſide of the Cup and Platter, but within there was nothing but filthineſs and naſtineſs. They were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out as whited Sepulchres, but within Sepulchres ſtill that is full of dead mens bones, and all rottenneſs; they did devour Widows Houſes,</hi> teach undutifulneſs to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now what could theſe men therefore, that yet ſought to be juſtified by the Law, uphold themſelves withall, but in outward conformities, even to an exceſs in ceremonious obſervances?

            </p>
            <p>Now I ſhall obſerve in a few word what invented ceremonies they had, beſides thoſe which the Law laid, upon them, in which alſo they gloryed; and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64817:88"/>then apply that part of the Character to our ſelves, or the preſent age which concerns Ceremonies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded or invented. We find often, that our Saviour charged the Phariſees with <hi>teaching for Doctrines the Commandments, Traditions and Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Mark 7.7. For, laying aſide the Commandments of God,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ye hold the tradition of men, as the waſhing of Pots and Cups, and many other ſuch like things ye do:</hi> One of which things among the many other, was their Phylacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſaith they were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own; and if it were not too large, I would here tranſcribe all that he ſayes upon it in his Comment on <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.5. I cannot omit ſome things.
<q>Theſe Phylacteries (ſaith he) were a great part (though a great miſtake and deceit) of the Religion of the latter <hi>Jews,</hi> upon God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.16. of binding thoſe words, <hi>for a ſign upon their hands, and as front lets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their eyes;</hi> which certainly were but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive expreſtions of that which was before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them diligently, &amp;c.</hi> This carnal people, which were apt to turn all inward Piety into outward Formality, would needs underſtand this Precept litterally, and made them Scrouls of Parchment, in which they wrote four ſections of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> (he mentions which they were.) Theſe Rolls of Parchment were by them prepared with a great multitude of Ceremonies and Decrees made by them, of the Creatures of whoſe Skins that Parchment was to be made; of the Knives with which it was to be cut, and a great deal more: Being made, they ſitted and applyed them to the fore-heads, and to the wriſts, and they were called <hi>Phylacleries,</hi> either
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64817:88"/>becauſe they were to help keep the Law in their memory, or becauſe they were a kind of Amulet or Charm againſt Faſcinations and Diſeaſes; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Malus Genius,</hi>
               </q> ſaith <hi>Paulus Fagius.</hi> This the learned Doctor tells us was a great part of their Religion, and yet a matter of pure invention, attended with a great multitude of ceremonies. I may not here omit the ſtory of <hi>Micah, Judg.</hi> 17. who had a houſe-full of Gods, v. 5. and had made an Ephod and Teraphim, and for want of a Prieſt, conſecrated one of his Sons; but yet at laſt light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a poor Levite of <hi>Bethleem-Judah,</hi> a young man that had no charge, he bargains with him for ten ſhekels of ſilver by the year, about fifty ſhillings perhaps, a Sute of Apparel, and Victuals; and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> he conſecrates the <hi>Levite</hi> for his Prieſt, and what follows? Why an high confidence of Divine acceptance: <hi>Now I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Lord will do me good, ſeeing I have a Levite to my Prieſt.</hi> This is the confidence of a great Idolater, meerly from a <hi>Levite</hi>-Prieſt for his falſe Gods; in which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is plain he pretended to worſhip the Lord the true God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give but one place more about inventions; it is <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>Wherefore if ye be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the world, why (as though living in the world,</hi> that is, living in a meer worldly Religion, a humane, external, and for the moſt part invented thing) <hi>are ye ſubject to Ordinances,</hi> (ſuch as theſe, <hi>touch not, taſte not, handle not, which all are to periſh with the uſing) after the Commandments and Doctrines of men,</hi> which are words that expreſs humane inventions. That theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> herein were Legal, that <hi>Micah</hi> was Legal, that the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees that enlarged their <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> were Legal, I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64817:89"/>need not trouble my ſelf to prove, having in the beginning ſhewed the equal latitudes of legal and fleſhly, fleſhly and external, and the external, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, fleſhly way, to lie in dependance upon, and glorying in outward priviledges and performances either commanded or invented.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee what we have of theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which we do, or eaſily may play the <hi>Jews</hi> or Legal ſelf-Juſtitiaries in, and then paſs on. For this is the chief thing in the Characters that I have to mind, <hi>viz.</hi> how far they may concern us, that ſo they may ſerve us for trial and examination how far we are inclined to a Legal way of ſerving God. The <hi>Jews</hi> fault was, that they over-prized Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, Feſtivals, New-Moons, whilſt they were their duty to obſerve them. The <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians</hi> fault was, that they medled with them at all Now as for our people, truly I think the generality, (I ſpeak not of the great Zealots for Ceremonies) do not place much in Holy-dayes, as to Religion; their greateſt danger is from prophaneneſs upon Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, in their <hi>Whitſun-Ales</hi> and <hi>Wakes,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Again, the <hi>Jews</hi> thought themſelves very pure and holy, if they kept themſelves from Legal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, and from eating every thing that was unclean, and placed too much in this, whilſt it was
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64817:89"/>their duty to obſerve theſe things. The <hi>Coloſsians</hi> erred but in making conſcience of the Legal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs of Meats; <hi>Let no man judge you,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in meat or drink;</hi> that is, value no man's judgement, let no man abridge you of your liberty in it. Now for our ſelves, we are wholly free from <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Obſervations about meats, and I think pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty free from any Religious Obſervations at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout meats; and if we are forbid fleſh in <hi>Lent</hi> thoſe that are healthy, yet the reaſon which the Law gives, is civil and political for the breed of Cattel; but if we ſhould come to have our Conſciences en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared to think, that fleſh were not as lawful in it ſelf all the <hi>Lent</hi>-time, as at another time; this were a ſymptome of Legality, venting it ſelf in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. But now if we go over amongſt the Papiſts, what conſcientious obſervations of Meats are there? To eat an Egg in <hi>Lent,</hi> is puniſhed with impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; that upon a religious account, which is a plain argument of legality amongſt them very riſe. I might inſtance in Prieſts Veſtments, as I apprehend an high piece of formality, very fit to pleaſe the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of a Legal Spirit, that for want of ſubſtance, pleaſes it ſelf with ſhadows, ſhews and outſides; but I ſhall not proceed further to touch at things; he that hath an eye to ſee, let him look into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and he that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches. But we may ſpeak freey of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> &amp; their Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not onely in doing, but in putting themſelves upon needleſs ſufferings; What Pilgrimages and Proceſſionings; what Abſtinencies and Penances do they put themſelves upon, wearing Sackcloath, ſcourging themſelves? What croſſings, cringings and ſprinklings do they impoſe upon themſelves?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64817:90"/>'twere endleſs almoſt but to name the kinds of their inventions: Yea ſome of our own people will ſay over the Creed and ten Commandments for a prayer, and when they come as beggars at your door, they will ſay over the Lords, Prayer, as if it were a charm to the houſe from all miſchief. Now I look upon all Superſtitions, where they are with any ſeriouſneſs practiſed, as thoſe things which do exactly ſit a Legal Spirit; for, as I have ſeveral times intimated, your Legalliſts cannot endure to come at the Law in the ſpiritual ſenſe of it, ſo none but a Goſpel-Spirit doth; it is Faith alone that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſheth the Law, and obeys the Law: Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Legalliſt cannot endure to come up to the true ſpiritual obedience of the Law, and yet ſeeks to be juſtified by Works; he is fain to find out a thouſand things to pleaſe himſelf, and ſatisfie his Conſcience with, whereby he thinks he makes God amends; and we have ſeen in the inſtances before us, how that though men are as wicked as they could be, by lying, ſwearing, and committing adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yea and Idolatry too; yet they cryed, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord; they thought God muſt love them becauſe they were <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially when they brought him rich Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and burnt rich Incenſe, and kept all their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals in the time and manner appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now <hi>what then their over-valuing the Commands of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romonial Law was, that is Superſtition to us now.</hi> For not having ſuch a Law left us by God, we find out ſomewhat like it, and place the ſame conſidences in it that they did in their Law; <hi>onely ours is ſo much the worſe by not being of Divine inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now only one particular more belonging to this Character of external fleſhly ſervice; and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64817:90"/>that is, an external partial conformity to the moral Law, which is indeed the laſt and ſtrongeſt fort of a Legal-ſpirit. As for theſe external Priviledges or Ceremonies and Superſtitious Performances which I have inſiſted upon, they are a ſlighty thin cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if we come once to try it, and rationally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it; and though people wrap themſelves in it, yet they cannot bear out any rough argument from galling or pinching through it.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64817:91"/>that are referred to; he was no actual Adulterer, but might he not commit heart-Adultery? He was no Extortioner or unjuſt perſon, as he ſaith: But if it were true at all, it may be it was onely thus, That he was not ſo in the higheſt degree; perhaps what others accounted injuſtice and extortion, he did not: But I need not go upon a <hi>Perhaps;</hi> I will lead the Reader to a certain place of Scripture where the Legalliſt prides himſelf, and challenges acceptance from God onely upon a partial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obedience unto ſome duties of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2, 3.

Here you ſee external conformities to the duties of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law may fill men with a pride, ſo far as to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge divine acceptance, making no queſtion but they have well deſerved the favour of Almighty God, whilſt in the mean time they are oppreſſors and exactors; which argues, that a legal way in the ſervice of God, is a fleſhly and external way. And beſides, I obſerve in this Scripture that we may as well let our Legality run out in Divine Services in duties of Worſhip, as in ſecond-Table-duties; and indeed I think that is a worſe kind of Legality (for it is uſually attended with more wickedneſs) than when men take up with being juſt and true in their dealings with men. Thus our rude people if they go to Morning and Evening prayer, and join with the Church in the ſervice bymaking their reſponds, and obſerving the ſeveral geſtures of ſitting, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and kneeling, they are ready to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an opinion that they are very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, though they are known wicked people. I ſhall now apply the Character, though I have done little elſe all this while; but now I ſhall do it more profeſſedly.</p>

If thou valueſt theſe things beyond the true ſpiritual Worſhip of God, thou art a Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt of the worſt ſort; for there are two kinds of Legal perſons better then thy ſelf, who yet periſh.

Now I ſay, there may be many of theſe that yet are not juſtified, and ſo have not put themſelves upon the right way of Juſtification. Now what can be their ruine? Truly nothing but one of theſe two, Either that they know ſome luſt in themſelves which they wil not part with; or elſe that they have deluded themſelves to think that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64817:92"/>they are holy enough, and ſo holy as God is well pleaſed with them. Now I am ſo charitable as to think, that when men have come up ſo high as to be near the Kingdom of God, they do not allow themſelves in a groſs known ſin; therefore their ruine muſt ariſe from hence, that they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves holy enough, and that they have merited the favour of God by being ſo much better than their neighbours, as the Phariſees in the Parable did; and this yet is Legality, and that which is moſt properly ſo called</p>
            <p>Now though there are many that are near the Kingdom of God, and yet periſh by Legality;

            <p>By what I have ſaid, I ſuppoſe men may examine themſelves whether they are guilty of predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Legality by reſting upon an external or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial performance of the duties of the Moral Law. of which I have made two ſorts, a lower, and an higher, and <hi>I</hi> free both from being neceſſarily ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, or that their chief danger ſhould ariſe from thence: And for the firſt ſort <hi>I</hi> ask, Art thou careleſs of getting divine knowledge in the Scriptures?

Art not thou put to ſtruglings, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ſightings? &amp; yet expecteſt thou to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Why then thou art one of the common ſort that periſh by reſting upon an outward conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Moral Law.</p>
            <p>Again, for the higher, but unſincere Moraliſt; Doſt thou find a difficulty in Religion? Is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to break thine heart almoſt, with the trouble that it puts thee to? Thou art fain to be conſtant in duties morning and evening, and it may be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; thou art juſt between man and man; it may be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64817:94"/>thou beſtoweſt much of thine Eſtate upon the poor, and many other good things thou doſt; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou haſt ſome time or other parted with ſome very beloved ſin, that was to thee as a right eye, or a right hand; thou haſt found Religion coſtly and troubleſome to thee; and now thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteſt when ever thou dieſt, to go to Heaven. But ſtay man, art thou humble? Doſt thou ſee no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in thy ſelf notwithſtanding thy ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative holineſs beyond thy neighbours? Art not thou made ſometimes to confeſs before the Lord, and that with great brokenneſs of heart, that thou art an unprofitable ſervant? Art not thou made to admire at the rich Grace of God, that he ſhould take pity on thee when thou waſt in thy blood? That he ſhould have thoughts of love to thee, ſhould ſend his good Spirit into thine heart to move thee, and turn thee to himſelf, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> If thou haſt experience of none of theſe things, be thou as ſtrict as thou wilt, ſo that hone can accuſe thee; ſo ſtrict that thine own Conſcience doth not loudly accuſe thee; I tell thee (whether thou be ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ceremonious yea orno; for it ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but ſuch an one as thou art is ſo) thou art one of thoſe that are indeed not far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, but yet not in it, nor ever ſhall be whileſt thou continueſt ſo; thou art a Legal ſelf-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiary, that reſteſt in an external unſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of God. I have perfectly done with the Character as it is given to diſcover pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Legality. Yet here I ſhal enter two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one concerning the Moraliſt, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Papiſt.
<note place="margin">A cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the term Moraliſt.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For the term Moraliſt which I uſe, I fear it may give offence to ſome ingenuous and worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64817:95"/>and therefore I thus explain my ſelf, that I do not oppoſe Moral to Spiritual, as if the moſt ſpiritual Commands of the Goſpel were not Moral; or as if the moſt ſpiritual Saint were not the higheſt Moralliſt; or as if Morality were a low Principle; I know not but I may reduce all the duties of the Goſpel to Morality; and I think no ſober man wil deny them to be Moral Duties: But I make uſe of it as part of that common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction made betwixt thoſe two kinds of Laws which <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered, of which ſome were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceremonial and typical, and to laſt but for a time; the other Moral, that is to ſay, according to the common underſtanding of it, Perpetual; though as to the Etymological ſignification of the Word, Moral ſignifies as much as that which concerns Manners: So Moral Philoſophy is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all other Philoſophy, as Practical is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Speculative; and in this ſignification of the Word Moral, all the ceremonial Laws whilſt they were in uſe, might have been called Moral; but becauſe uſe ſwayes Language more then the Etymology of Words, I here underſtand the Word Moral purely in oppoſition to ceremonial or ſuperſtitious; ſo as it ſignifies thoſe duties that are to be performed by us, as having a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial goodneſs in their own nature, ſuch as Juſtice, Mercy, and Prayer, &amp;c. Now thoſe men that depend for a righteouſneſs upon the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unſincere performance of theſe duties I call Legal Moralliſts, of which there are evidently two ſorts,

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64817:95"/>in whom I have inſtanced often in the matter of Ceremonies and Superſtitions, and their placing a confidence in them. And to ſhew that I do not delight to diſparage ſo much as any one man, much leſs an whole party of men (but that my onely aim is to make true proof of my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) I ſhall, to do them right, quote an Author of their own, whereby it wil appear plainly that ſome of them (at leaſt) are ſenſible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> Ceremonious and ſuperſtitiou.

            <p>Now God forbid that I ſhould judge ſuch a man as this (if he but follow his own directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to be in a way deſtructive to his ſoul, when he profeſſeth to aim at true <hi>SPIRITUALWOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIP,</hi> not contenting himſelf with <hi>EXTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL ACTIONS</hi> onely in the ſervice of God, Though ſtill I muſt needs ſay (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an Author as this amongſt them) that (I think) the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do generally ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by reſting upon externals, nay inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ſervice of God. So much for the cautions, and for the Character, as it concerns thoſe that are under predominant Legality.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe the ſame character that will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it at this height, will diſcover it alſo where it is in any leſs degree; and for that I have aſſerted that there is a mixture of Legality in the ſervices of the beſt Chriſtians and Saints of God, I think it good to improve this character yet further, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that Legality which may be found in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64817:96"/>the Saints themſelves. That Legality of the Saints therefore which is diſcoverable and reprovable by this Character, is, 1. That I doubt not but ſome good men have a Conſcience of ſome ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervations, and I would not for all the world think; the contrary, leſt I ſhould condemn the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat on of the juſt, and think too hardly of ſome dear Saints of God. And I muſt needs confeſs, there is too much occaſion given men to run into this extream of Superſtition, by the irreverence of others (perhaps good men) in the ſervice of God. How ordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ily do many ſit at prayers in the Church, when they are not neceſſitated by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any other occaſion? and with their Hats upon their heads. Now how eaſily may this give occaſion to others that take offence at this irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, out of a fear leſt they ſhould not be reverent enough in the ſervice of God, to approve of kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sacrament, which I doubt not but many good men may be very zealous for, as alſo forbow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Name of Jeſus. But yet I reckon that good men are in greater danger of Legality in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Moral duties, then in ceremonies and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions; for though I have acknowledged that ſome good men may have a conſcience of ſome ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious obſervations, being miſled by the care to be ſufficiently reverent; yet to be greatly ſuperſtitious in Goſpel-days, is a ſhrewd ſign of a rotten heart, and ſo not ſo incident to good men. 2dly. For the duties of the Moral Law, good mens Legality lies in two particulars: 1. When they have performed a duty rightly and ſpiritually, they are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon it with a ſpiritual pride, and ready to lay too much ſtreſs upon it, and to think that now God muſt needs grant the Petitions they have ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereas perhaps they have anſwer enough in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64817:97"/>the very ſweetneſs of the duty it ſelf, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God which they have enjoyed in it; and therefore if they are not humbled after ſuch a duty, to ſee their great unworthineſs notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all they have done, they are ſo far guilty of Legality; Or which is more uſual, 2dly. The Saints too often content themſelves with doing their tale and number of duties, praying morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, perhaps reading ſo many Chapters, but are not ſpiritual in what they do, watching over their hearts that they worſhip God in a right manner with thoſe ſpiritual affections ſtirring in prayer, that attention in reading that ſhould be; this is commonly known by the name of reſting in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>egality, and yet I think that which is found more or leſs in all the Saints; and ſo far indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to themſelves by ſome Saints, till at laſt they have a general deadneſs and benummedneſs in all their Graces, and then they fall into ſad complaints of deſertions, and run into a maze and a Labyrinth of doubts and troubles of mind, which perhaps they get not out of for ſome years together. As for thoſe Saints that pick and chooſe amongſt the Commandments, that are high-flown in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet err groſly in matters of common Juſtice and honeſty, that are indeed not only ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſly reported, or unworthily ſuſpected to be ſo) diſobedient to Magiſtrates, with other like ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Chriſtians, I have nothing to ſay to them here. I refer theſe to the head of hypocritical Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galliſts, that expect to be juſtified by a parcial obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Commands of the Moral Law, <hi>theſe not being ſpots of Gods Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other miſcarriages of the Saints in duties that are to be referred to their Legality of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64817:97"/>Spirit; as for inſtance, if they chance through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſions to have miſſed the time of prayer morning or evening, to have miſſed the reading their number of Chapters, or doing any good task which they had laid upon themſelves, then they have a great fear and terror, leſt God ſhould be angry and diſpleaſed with them, though indeed Mercy was at ended inſtead of Sacrifice; but ſuch as theſe belong to another head or character of a Legal Spirit, to wit, a Spirit of Bondage, which I ſhall come unto anon.</p>
            <p>I have now perfectly done with the firſt Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter as to its explication, proof, and application, both to Legality predominant, and that which is found in a leſs degree, in which I may be thought tedious enough: Onely I would not leave ſo much as a cavil, without ſome endeavour at leaſt of an anſwer to it Now I am ſenſible that thoughts may ariſe in ſome, as if this whole particular were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Whoever thought before (may they chance ſay) that Superſtition was Legality? that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al performance of the Moral Law, either by the leſs ſtrict, or more ſtrict Moralliſts, was Legality? If men would ſeek to be juſtified by the Law, they would endeavour at leaſt to keep the whole Law; and if they knew they fell ſhort of it, as thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane wicked men which you mention out of <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Jeremiah,</hi> and other places, that were very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did, and yet reſted in Ceremonious performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and external Priviledges, theſe indeed deſerve the Name of wicked men, but not of Legalliſts, or ſuch as ſeek juſtification by the Law.</p>
            <p>Now to this I anſwer, and I ſhall ſay but little more then what I have ſaid before; 1. 'Tis true,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64817:98"/>none ought to ſeek Juſtification by the Law, but thoſe that have perfectly kept it hitherto, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to keep it for the future part of their lives. 2. If any ſeek juſtification any other way, they do but be-fool themſelves. 3. But yet the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> did ſeek juſtification by Works, by the Law; ASIT WERE by the Works of the Law; elſe the Apoſtle had diſputed againſt no adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And yet they did not pretend to perfect and unerring obedience. So I reckon the objection is anſwered already, that men may ſeek Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Law, that have not, nor think they have the exact Works of it. But yet to give ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of anſwer: There being a generation of men that do ſeek Juſtification by the Works of the Law, yea, foraſmuch as all men are apt to ſeek it this way, it muſt be in ſome kind of actions or other: Now I have ſhewn that theſe very men that are taxed for Legality by the Apoſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> they were alſo taxed for their being ſo much in love with ceremonies and ſuperſtitions, and with external obedience (onely) to the Moral Law; and I cannot learn wherein elſe their fault of Legality lay; therefore this muſt be their Legality: For it is certain they muſt vent their Legality in ſomthing, in ſome way or other; and I finding no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great way of theirs, but one of theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> ceremonies, ſuperſtitions, and external conformity to themoral law, which all agree in this general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an external and fleſhly ſervice, ſuch as doth not reach the heart, conclude that their way bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it ſelf forth onely into theſe three particulars. Beſides I have ſhewn that there was a continual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Legalliſts from the beginning, &amp; they all agree in this general of external ſervice, therefore this muſt be the very matter of their Legality. And
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64817:98"/>for full proof, having ſhewn what is the form of Legality, to wit, expecting the reward as of Debt, or Merit. I have found out this form enlivening and quickening this fleſhly matter of the Legalliſts ſervice and obedience to God. Thus I have ſhewn how the ceremonious <hi>Jew</hi> with his appointed Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and invented Superſtitions, <hi>Micah</hi> in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> and the Legal <hi>Jew</hi> in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Micah,</hi> made no doubt but to DESERVE very well the favour of Almighty God.

So would the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and our ſelves (many of us) wonder, that upon crying, <hi>Lord, Lord open to us,</hi> after we had been ſo ſuperſtitious and ceremonious in his ſervice on earth, we ſhould be ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven. I come now to the ſecond Character.</p>
            <p>The ſecond mark or ſign of a Legal Spirit by which it may be found out, is this, That it is proud and impatient in the ſervice of God. I ſhall give Scripture-proof that a Legal Spirit is proud and impatient, and Scripture-inſtances. For a ſinful creature to think that it can merit, is pride in it ſelf; yet this I have proved already, that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> and all that practiſe Legality, are for the Doctrine of Merit, and they make no doubt but they ſhall very well deſerve the favour of God; ſome by their rich Sacrifices and high Superſtitions, others by their external obedience to the Commands of the Moral Law. <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith <hi>Micah) now God will do me good: God I thank thee that I am ſo much better then other men,</hi> ſaith the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64817:99"/>and upon this challengeth his acceptance, they take it for granted that God cannot but be well pleaſed with them. This is their pride in its direct and formal act. But now, what if the Lord ſhew them ſome diſlike? Why there we ſhall ſee their pride in its effects, impatience, anger, wearineſs, fullenneſs. I gave one inſtance of diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God in the former haracter, <hi>Iſa</hi> 58.3, 4. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſoul, and thou takeſt no pleaſure?</hi> They ſeem to take it very ill at God's hands.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance we have in <hi>Cain,</hi> who when he found that God did not accept him with an anſwer from heaven, as he did <hi>Abel,</hi> he is ſullen, and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and falls into an angry and malicious paſſion; <hi>Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell, Gen.</hi> 4.3. 4 and in ver. 6. God comes graciouſly to argue him out of this angry and ſu len fit: <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Cain, Why art thou wrath? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> Do but as <hi>Abel</hi> hath done, offer in faith, offer thy heart with thy Sacrifice, and thou ſhalt be accepted as he was. No, but <hi>Cain</hi> ('tis like) thought he had done well enough in <hi>bringing the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord,</hi> and that he might very well have deſerved to be accepted as well as his younger Brother; and therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues his wrath and malice, and perhaps if he could have had his will at the great God (for it was againſt him that his paſſion was chiefly ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) he would have diſcovered the utmoſt malice againſt him. But becauſe he could not, his poor ſervant, and true ſpiritual Worſhipper <hi>Abel</hi> muſt rue it, and he takes his firſt opportunity, and kills him, ver. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:64817:99"/>Others again of <hi>Cain</hi>'s gang, Legal-Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, when they have found that God did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them (as they thought he might well have done) they are quite weary of his ſervice, and cry out with thoſe in <hi>Malachi,</hi> chap. 1. ver. 13. <hi>Ye have ſaid alſo, Behold what a wearineſs is it! And ye have ſnuffed at it:</hi> And ſo <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5 they cry, <hi>When will the new Moon be gone, and the Sabbath, that we may ſet forth Wheat? Will ſuch hypocrites</hi> (think you) <hi>pray alwayes? Will they alwaies call upon God?</hi> No, <hi>where a man doth not ſind acceptance, he will be at laſt weary of waiting.</hi> Now, though whoſoever comes with faith and love and an hearty-good-will, ſhall be ſure to ſind acceptance with God, yet an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, or a Legal-Worſhipper ſhall never find it; and therefore he will be apt ever now and then to grow weary, if not quite to caſt off the ſervice of God. I ſhall inſtance in a proud ſpeech of one that was quite weary, it was the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 King. 6.33. <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> (ſpeaking of the Famine in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria) This evil is of the Lord, and why ſhould I wait ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>

Would that ceaſe the Famine? No; but ſaith he by his Meſſenger, <hi>This evil is of the Lord;</hi> God deals ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hardly and ſeverely with us, therefore Ile cut off his ſervants Head. A goodly conſequence!
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64817:100"/>and that which ſuſſiciently argues againſt whom chieſly his anger was aimed, even againſt the Lord himſelf. Now that this anger, impatience, and wearineſs in the ſervice of God, is an argument of Legality, is clear, for that pride is the root of it, namely ſuch a pride as by which we think there is very good reaſon why God ſhould accept of us, and no juſt reaſon why the Lord ſhould deal thus ſeverely with us; which if it doth not contain Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, or opinion of merit in it, I deſpair of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any proof in this buſineſs; and yet I ſhall not onely give this proof by way of argument, but clear Scripture-proof that this impatiency pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Legality; it is in <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>Behold the viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhal speak, and not lye; though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry:</hi> This was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſe with the wicked King laſt inſtanced out of 2 <hi>King</hi> 6.33. <hi>if the Viſiontarry, wait for it:</hi> But now it follows <hi>ver.</hi> 4. If you will not wait, if your ſoul be lifted up in you with pride and impatience, why this <hi>ſoul that is lifted up, is not upright in him;</hi> this Spirit is quite contrary to the Spirit of a juſt and juſtified man: <hi>But the juſt ſhall live by Faith;</hi> that is, will be patient in ſuch ſtraits; this is the great famous place which the Apoſtle <hi>Pau.</hi> makes uſe of to prove Juſtification by Faith in three ſeveral Epiſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 38. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Impatience, wearineſs of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God is a great argument and ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Legal Spirit in the ſervice of God, the thing that we have now under demonſtration.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this Character: So far as thou findeſt thy ſelf ſloathful, ſluggiſh in the ſervice of God, ready to draw back, and to be weary of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing; contentious againſt God, with <hi>Job;</hi> angry,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64817:100"/>as <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> were in their ſits of diſtemper. So far Legality is diſcovered to be the principle of ſerving God. For the Spirit of the Goſpel is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; chearful; <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him,</hi> ſaith the Church in <hi>Micah,</hi> ch. 7 9. If God defers to hear and anſwer prayers, yea gives denials, yet the true Saints of God think it their duty to wait patiently on the Lord, and to find out the cauſe of theſe denials in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Chriſt calls the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> Dog; <hi>Truth Lord, ſaith ſhe, yet the Dogs eat of the crumbs:</hi> And this is commended for an high piece of faith, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.28 I join theſe Scriptures of Old and New-Teſtament together, and uſe them promiſcuouſly for proof of the ſame thing, becauſe it is plain there were ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Worſhippers under the Old-Teſtament, as wel as there are Legal-Worſhippers in the new.</p>
            <p>Now in a conſonancy to, and connexion with this latter part of this laſt Character, <hi>viz.</hi> the irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs, heavineſs, and weary ſomneſs that there is often found in a Legal Spirit as to the ſervice of God, I might make this a third Character, That a Legal Spirit is weak and feeble, and devoid of all ſtrength in the ſervice of God: But I ſhall make this rather an Obſervation then a Character of a Legal Spirit; yet I ſhall inſiſt ſome what upon it.</p>
            <p>I ſay then,
<note place="margin">The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſpirit is without, ſtrength in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</note> That the Legal-Worſhipper is faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted &amp; weak in the ſervice of God, like <hi>Ephraim</hi> in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.11. <hi>as a ſilly Dove without heart;</hi> and it may very well be, for the <hi>joy of the Lord</hi> alone <hi>is our ſtrength, Neh.</hi> 8.10. Which joy the Legalliſt never partakes of, having never any true ſence of divine acceptance: And indeed, what ſtrength can the Law give, us that is now, through our fall, become
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64817:101"/>a poor, weak, feeble thing it ſelf? <hi>What the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8.3. The Law became weak through our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fleſh, ſo that it can neither juſtifie, nor ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and it gives no quickneſs at all in the ſervice of God; it gives quickneſs to the body of death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and to the motions of ſin in our members, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They would make this another Character of a legal Spirit,
<note place="margin">A ſalfe Character of a Legal Spirit.</note> That it is ſelfiſh and mercenary in the ſervice of God, onely works for wages and for the reward, but doth nothing out of pure love, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and ingenuity. I have heard it delivered in a great Aſſembly as a great obſervation, That <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love hath no more Religion in it than an Horſe.</hi> That is, as I underſtand it, ſo far as a man acts towards God for any good that ſhould accrue to himſelf; ſo far his Religion is unacceptable. Now for the word <hi>ONELY,</hi> I confeſs I know not what to ſay to that, how that ſhould be a good Spirit that worſhips and ſerves God <hi>ONELY</hi> for the reward. But I ſuppoſe, they that ſpeak undervaluingly of this Principle, do mean, or at leaſt ſhould mean by the tendency of their Diſcourſes, that it is a legal Principle to ſerve God in hope of the reward, or for the reward, and that ſo far as we ſerve God from this Principle, we are legal, or at leaſt we miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64817:103"/>in ſo doing. And indeed to ſhew that I do not ſlander a party, I have heard ſeveral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes wherein this hath been hotly argued, that it is not a right, or at leaſt not a Goſpel-Principle to ſerve God for fear of Hed, which is to me all one as to ſerve him in hope of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for to avoid Hell is a negative reward, as the enjoying Heaven is a poſitive. Now for my part I think (whatever we may account of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love when it is the onely principle) yet, that it is a very good principle in other honeſt company, and withall I think that there is no Saint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth that doth act towards God meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the principle of ſelf-love, which I ſhall ſhew by and by: But I will ſay more yet, and that is this, That I think ſelf-love, or acting for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to labour in hope, as the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth, who not onely laboureth in hope, but for his hope or for that which he expecteth elſe he would not have taken that labour) I ſay, to act for the reward, or in hope of the reward, and ſo likewiſe that we may avoid Hell needs not ſo far the aſſociation of other Principles to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and credit it, as if it were not it ſelf a right Goſpel-Principle, for I think, to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the reward which the Goſpel promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on purpoſe, that ſo we might be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, argues a true Goſpel-ſpirit, anſwering the Goſpel-motive; and ſo that outward motive from the Word or Promiſe, becomes an inward Principle.</p>
            <p>It were endleſs to quote the Scriptures that encourage us in holineſs by the conſideration of glory to come. <hi>Be thou faithful to the death, and I will give thee the Crown of Life,</hi> Rev. 2.10. One more; <hi>That which ye have already, hold faſt till I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64817:103"/>come; and he that overcometh and keepeth my words unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, (and he ſhall rule them with a rod of Iron) even as I received of my Father, and I will give him the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Star,</hi> Rev. 2 25, 26 27, 28 So it is likewiſe a Goſpel-principle to ſerve God that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Hell: We have both together, to get Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and avoid Hell, made Goſpel-motives, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, 29 <hi>Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have Grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> And it is the advice of our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.5. <hi>To fear God who can caſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul into Hell; and for that</hi> reaſon, <hi>I ſay unto you my friends, fear him;</hi> they are our Saviours Words. <hi>Luke</hi> 12 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Now with whatever fair ſhews and pretences men may impoſe theſe Doctrines upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, that they muſt not ſerve God for fear of Hell, nor hope of Heaven; I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Satan to be the Forger of theſe devices; for if he can get us once out of the fear of Hell, and out of the hopes of Heaven, hee'l make no doubt to bring us into what temptations ſoever he ſhall intice us with.</p>
            <p>And I would fain know what the other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are, when theſe are removed upon which we ſhould be conſtrained or engaged to ſerve God. There is indeed one more leſt very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; but theſe men that diſlike the hope of reward, and fear of puniſhment, will not like this neither; and it is becauſe it is the duty of the Creature to ſerve its Creator, whether he promiſeth any reward or no. Now this will not look neither like a Goſpel-principle, being the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64817:104"/>very Law of Creation. Well then, what princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will they ſuggeſt for Goſpel-principles? Why ſuch as theſe, Love, and Ingenuity, and Gratitude, and apprehending an excellency in the wayes of God. Now I confeſs theſe are good principles, and theſe are right Goſpel-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the fruit of the Spirit is love; <hi>And, we love him, becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> 1 John 4.19. which is gratitude; <hi>Shall we continue in ſin becauſe we are not under the Law, but under Grace, and that ſo Grace may abound? God forbid.</hi> This were highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1.15. <hi>And in keeping thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, there is great reward,</hi> Pſal. 19.11. There is a ſight of the excellency of the precept. But pray obſerve, that <hi>where nobleneſs and ingenuity is the onely Principle of Actions, there is no neceſſity for any thing to be done at all;</hi> for actions of nobleneſs, and ingenuity, and gratitude, come under no Law, but are left free to the Agent to do, or not to do; only that hereby as he doth them or not, the Agent will diſcover whether he be of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Spirit or no. And thus theſe men have brought things to a fair paſs, that God is to be ſerved under the Goſpel onely upon courteſie; ſo that any that will, may ſlip their neck out of Chriſts yoke, and their back from under his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or elſe they muſt acknowledge that men ought to ſerve God, becauſe there is a <hi>MUST</hi> upon it; 'tis our duty as Creatures, if we will not, there is an Hell to puniſh; but to encourage you in it, if you will, there is an Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>And what if a Legal Spirit go to work with theſe principles ONELY, as indeed I think he hath no other, and that he may have all theſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64817:104"/>in a degree, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſenſe of his Obligation as a Creature, the fear of Hell, and ſome general hope of Heaven: I ſay, What if he may have all theſe principles, are they evertheleſs good or unſuitable to the Goſpel, becauſe he uſeth them? If he uſed them to good ends, or uſed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, they would do him good, as well as they do others good; the reaſon why theſe do him no good, is, for that in the uſe of the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the general, which a good man may uſe, A Legalliſt hath always theſe three groſs defects that undo him.
<note place="margin">Three ruining defects in the ſervice of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galliſt.</note> Firſt, though the hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in general, as a place of happineſs, may ſomewhat quicken him in what he doth, yet he hath no true notion or apprehenſion of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that the happineſs of it conſiſts chiefly in likeneſs to God, in holineſs, which if it were his notion of Heaven, he could not find in his heart to deſire it, much leſs to endeavour after it. The ſecond groſs defect is this; All the endeavours that he makes to pleaſe God in one thing or in another, (as I have inſtanced in ſeveral wayes) never reach to a thorough heart-work; whereas that is the chief thing that God looks after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Spirit, &amp; the Father of Spirits. And the laſtthing is this, That yet, for all this ſlighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; hypocrifie of a Legal Spirit, the very rule that he proceeds by in his expectations of his Reward, is, That <hi>God is bound</hi> to give it him, <hi>as having well deſerved it</hi> at his hands. Now what though a Legalliſt may make uſe of the ſame principles that an Evangelical Spirit doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfully, yet what ſhould hinder but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Worſhipper may uſe the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples rightly, and with acceptation from God?
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64817:105"/>May not a good thing be abuſed, or not rightly uſed? And doth this deſtroy the nature of it.</p>
            <p>Let us now a little examine the word Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, becauſe indeed it ſounds harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if it were a low principle for a Chriſtran to act towards God by; and then we will ſee briefly, what other Principles there are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with it in every true Saint of God. The word Mercenary, founds ſo ill meerly from the common uſage of it, not ſo much from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymology or native ſignification; the Natural ſignification of it is, when any one acts for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or for a reward: the uſe of it is when a man that is engaged to do courtifies, or at leaſt ſtands not in any need to receive courteſies, will yet do no good turns for any, without a good reward in his hand, or well aſſured to him; nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, will do any miſchief, if he may be well rewarded; ſo that Mercenarineſs is a Vice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies contrary to Nobleneſs, that is, more free to do, than receive courteſies, and often contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to juſtice; but now this Mercenarineſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as contrary to nobleneſs, is a Vice onely or chiefly amongſt equals, and thoſe that ſtand not in need of one another; as for thoſe that are far inferiour, it is pride with them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to receive courreſies, or rewards; for wherefore are any advanced in place, but that they may do good to thoſe that are below them. 'Tis no diſhonour at all for a poor man that wants bread, to hire our his labour for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; nor for a child that is bound, to do what his facher commands, to be encouraged by any reward that his father propoſeth to any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:64817:105"/>Now, let us apply theſe things to the bufi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before us, and we ſhall ſee how ill, or how well Mercenarineſs becomes us in our ſervice of God: Firſt of all, we are not here to conſider the Saints as doing evill things for a reward, that is the worſt Mercenarineſs of all; no, but they ſerve God for a reward. Now wherein can the ſordidneſs of this Spirit lye; is it that we need not to receive courteſies at the hands of God? or that we cannot endure to receive a courteſie which we know we are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite? Such a ſtruin of nobleneſs there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found amongſt men; out if we ſhould aim at ſuch a ſtrain of nobleneſs with God, How will ſuch men ever offer to receive heaven, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they did not work for it, which makes it far more obliging? Truely, in my minde, it is very high pride for a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is poor, and blind, and naked, and in want of all things, that, when God offers to ſupply his poverty, to cure his blindneſs, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his nakedneſs, he ſhall not be exceedingly over-joyed at it; and ſeeing that theſe ſupplies are of this nature, that they cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly obtained till we come to heaven, nor yet certainly obtained, except we perſevere whileſt we are here, to labour after them, it ſeems a ſtrange wantonneſs to me that men ſhould not labor, and own it that they do labour for them, as the command is,
<note place="margin">No fault in labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a debt.</note> 
               <hi>Labour for that meat which periſheth not, John</hi> 6.27. 3. The truth is, I cannot apprehend any fault in this principle of acting for a reward, except it ſhould have that formality or <hi>Quatenus</hi> in it, that it is for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as of debt. Doth the Scripture any where complain of any of the ſervants of God, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64817:106"/>they ſerved him for what they got by him? Or forbid them to ſerve him for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they got by him? 'Tis true, our Saviour upbraids ſome of his Followers, that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him <hi>becauſe of the Loaves, John</hi> 6 26. But if they had been followers as well of his Doctrine and Life, as they were of his bodily preſence, though it had been as well for the Loaves of Bread for a natural life, as of the Bread of Life from Heaven, they had never received ſuch a check.</p>
            <p>'Tis onely an accuſation made by the Devil, that <hi>Job</hi> ſerved God for what he got by him. <hi>Doth Job ſerve God for nought?</hi> Haſt not thou made a Hedge about him? &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. And what if <hi>Job</hi> did ſerve God for this reaſon partly? Is it not better to ſerve God for ſomething, then to ſerve the Devil for nothing but lying-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Hell at laſt? But, as <hi>I</hi> intimated before, ſo now I affirm, That no true Saint of God acts towards God onely from this principle of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love; there are other Goſpel-principles that are in the heart of every Saint more or leſs, as love to God, ingenuity, gratitude; yea, there are in ſome, ſtrains of higheſt nobleneſs and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. <hi>We love God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19.) <hi>becauſe he loved us firſt;</hi> there is Love and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? <hi>Shall we ſin that Grace may abound? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</hi> This I have ſaid to be ingenuity. There have been Saints that have demonſtrated to all the World that they did not ſerve God barely for a reward, either for a temporal reward, no nor for that which is Eternal in ſome ſtrains of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for the temporal reward, I think all the Saints do uſually diſcover this, becauſe they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64817:106"/>look upon it as their portion, when they come into the ſervice of God, to meet with ſufferings in the World; and there is an evident inſtance for this in <hi>Job,</hi> whom God made an example of the greateſt outward, yea and inward troubles too in a great meaſure, for this very end, as one great reaſon, that he might make the Devil a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, who accuſed <hi>Job</hi> to have ſerved God only for theſe many bleſſings which the Lord had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon him, as we may ſee in the 9.10, 11. ver. of that 1. of <hi>Job; Put forth thine hand</hi> (ſaith the Devil to the Lord) <hi>and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face;</hi> which yet <hi>Job</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, though yet the Lord did more againſt <hi>Job,</hi> then here Satan deſired to have done. But <hi>I</hi> ſhall touch at higher inſtances, they are thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and St. <hi>Paul;</hi> The firſt of which was content to have <hi>his Name blot ted out of the Book of life, Exod.</hi> 32. the other to <hi>be acourſed from Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 9.1, 2, 3. each for their Brethren, their Kinsfolk according to the fleſh, that ſo God might be glorified in their ſalvation; <hi>Ergo,</hi> whilſt theſe men were thus ſpirited, they ſerved God rather for his glory, then for their own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for they that would fain have been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to ſerve others by their preaching and exhortations, and yet were content for their ſakes, ſo they might be ſaved, not to be ſaved themſelves, did not ſerve God in preaching to men, for their own ſalvation onely, chiefly, nor indeed at all, whilſt they are thus conſidered. Here you ſee I acknowledge thus much to the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and I think <hi>I</hi> meet them half way, and <hi>I</hi> would it might ſatisfie them; <hi>I</hi> acknowledg
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64817:107"/>that no Saint acts to God purely from a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſelf-love; there are other good Principles in aſſociation with it; and in the next place I acknowledge that, ſome Saints may act, at leaſt in ſome ſtrains, ſo nobly, ſo generouſly, as to ſerve God faithfully, and yet not mind their own ſalvation at all: witneſs <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> as to temporal good things at leaſt. But yet upon theſe inſtances of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs in ſerving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od.</note> I would make theſe Obſervations. 1. That high ſtrain in which they both met, was but occaſional, and upon a ſuppoſition: it was no conſtant rule by which they walked; <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſtrain was this, That if God would deſtroy his people, he ſhould e'ne deſtroy him too; if he would not pardon their ſin in making the calf, he ſhould e'ne blot his name out of the Book of life: there was ſuch a near conjunction betwixt himſelf and his flock or people, that he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to out-live them: nay, perhaps that he did not deſire to go to heaven without a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of them: here was as it were a provocation to his noble love of his countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But I would fain know how this ſtrain could be any rule to <hi>Moſes</hi> in his walking? Or whether it ſignifies thus much? That he did not for his own particular, in his converſation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pleaſe God with this deſign partly, that he might obtain eternal life. Nay, is it not expreſly ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Hebr. 11.29. <hi>That he had reſpect unto the recompence of reward?</hi> So I might ſay of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> action, that it was a ſtrain onely upon a ſuppoſition, which ſuppoſition not coming to paſs, nor poſſible could be no ground for a Series of actions; For this was St,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64817:107"/>
               <hi>Pauls</hi> action; upon ſuppoſition that the Jews might be ſaved by his damnation, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be accurſed from Chriſt; which was a ſuppoſition impoſſible, that for the ſake of a man that had been, and ſtill was a ſinner, thouſands of ſinners ſhould be pardoned and ſaved. 2. It is not perfectly out of queſtion, Whether <hi>Moſes</hi> his action were warrantable: I have ſeen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators who ſay, that, <hi>This great zeal of his, might have ſome mixture of corrupt paſſion in it, which might make him to speak unadviſedly with his lips,</hi> Pſal. 106.33. And methinks there is ſome ſign of a reproof of this expreſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where he ſpeaks it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.32. For that the Lord in the next verſe, ſeems to repeat <hi>Moſes</hi> his words, with a reflection upon them, as when any is angry at expreſſions, they wil be apt to repeat them again with a diſpleaſure, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, whoſoever hath ſinned againſt me, him will I blot out of my book?</hi> Why ſhouldſt thou deſire to be blotted out? So I might perhaps aggravate Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> action: Why ſhould he deſire to be accurſed from Chriſt, that others might be bleſſed by Chriſt? Why ſhould he expreſs his love to the Jews in ſuch an high inſtance, eſpecially when it could ſtand them in no ſtead. Nay, for my part, I know not whether it be lawful for any man to be content for any ones ſake to loſe heaven, or be caſt into hell: methinks it is a piece of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatred, or at leaſt too high a breach upon that innate principle of ſelf-love which God hath planted in the ſoul. And certainly that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of love in our Saviour his dying for us (which yet was the higheſt inſtance in the world
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64817:108"/>of regular love) was not of ſuch a kind as this; for he did not dye for us to remain accurſed, but under-went the curſe, that ſo he might procure the bleſſing for his people, yea, and for himſelf, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> But in the third place, not to undertake to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> eſpecially in ſuch an action, where, if there was an error, it was onely in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of love to men's ſouls, and high nobleneſs and generoſity. I may ſafely adde this, that I proſeſs I cannot ſee how his action, or that of <hi>Moſes</hi> are imitable by us; for I know not by what rule we are obliged, or ſo much as permitted to do any ſuch action: though ſome would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that we are obliged to be content to be damned, that God may be glorified: thus far I ſhall go with them, <hi>That it is every ones du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be ſo humble, as to think that if God caſt us into hell, he doth us no wrong:</hi> But I cannot go ſo far in compliaure with their fantaſticall expreſſions of love, and ſubmiſſion to God, and deſigns for his glory, as to ſay, that if God may be glorified in my deſtruction, I am content, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas! What good can my deſtruction do to God? Or what glory can God have in deſtroying me, if I walk ſincerely with him? and therefore theſe are but fooliſh ſuppoſitions, and idle offers, which perhaps ſome good people may make; much-like thoſe in another caſe of enjoying communion with God, they will ſay, If God were in Hell, his Preſence would make Hell to be Heaven; and they had rather be in Hell with God, than in Heaven without him. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had better ſhew their love to God, and their
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64817:108"/>humility in thoſe actions and duties which he calls them unto, then in ſuch ſuppoſitions and fantaſtical expreſſions and imaginations as theſe: That is the third obſervation, I ſee not how this action of <hi>Moſes</hi> or St. <hi>Paul</hi> are imitable by us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Neither were they in conſtant practice by themſelves, or at leaſt they were not the onely principles which they acted by; for <hi>Moſes</hi> I have proved already that he had reſpect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward, and that encouraged him in doing and ſuffering for God. And as for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we find him <hi>preſſing towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and exhorting others ſo to do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14, 15. And though I doubt not but St. <hi>Paul</hi> did preach the Goſpel willingly, yet he tells us that he did not preach meerly as a free-will-offering to God; but there was a neceſſity upon him, he <hi>MUST</hi> do it; <hi>Though I preach the Gospel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yet I have nothing to glory of,</hi> (as if I had done a thing that I was not bound to do) for neceſſity is Iaid upon me, <hi>a diſpenſation is committed to me, yea wo is unto me if I preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.11.

I ſhall juſt give a brief account of the order of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in a Chriſtians acting for God, as I apprehend them to lie, and then ſhew why this of mercenarineſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made a Character of a Legal Spirie, and then come to give ſome more true Scripture-Characters.
<note place="margin">The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of principles in every Saints heart in his acting for God. The 3. firſt.</note> Now I ſuppoſe that the order of Principles in every Saints heart is this; 1. He conſiders himſelf a Creature, and ſo bound to obey his Creator; and ſince God hath alwayes propoſed ſome reward to the keeping, and threatning to the breach of his Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe three principles may go hand in hand together; and theſe are the firſt Principles that any is to begin with in ſerving God: Now I think there is no exceeding in any one of theſe Principles; a man cannot be too ſenſible of his obligation as a Creature to ſerve his Creator; a man cannot be too ſenſible of the greatneſs of the reward, nor of the danger of Hell; yet I think every Chriſtian hath ſomewhat more to move him in his ſervice to God then barely theſe three Principles; as for inſtance, ſome ſuch as I have named, love to God, gratitude, yea many times nobleneſs of heart. We love God (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſpeaking in the name of all the Saints, <hi>becauſe he loved us firſt, &amp;c.</hi> and theſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principles ſeem to follow in this order
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64817:109"/>from the firſt, that when I am thoroughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it is my duty to live to God, when I conſider what danger I avoid in it, what good I obtain by it, I am engaged to love that God,
<note place="margin">Then Love.</note> who takes ſuch care of his Creatures, that he would not have them periſh, nay, that he would not have them do their duty for nought; here is now another Principle, a Principle of Love, beyond the three firſt Principles: Again, I conſider the greatneſs of the reward, the richneſs of the grace in providing it by the gift of Chriſt, the Fathers giving him, and his giving himſelf; the ſending the Spirit into our hearts to perſwade us, and win upon us to accept of this grace; all the care that the Lord takes about us; and hereby I am yet more and more engaged to love and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
<note place="margin">Aſter that nobleneſs</note> One may eaſily be here ſet all in a flame of love, not counting his life dear for ſuch a God, for ſuch a Saviour; if there be the leaſt ſpark of Nobleneſs in one's natural ſpirit, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the whole ſoul to do ſome excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for God; not as the Legalliſt doth, ſuppoſing that hereby he ſhall oblige God, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps onely in ſome fantaſtical ſervice, as rich ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, or multitudes of ſuperſtitious obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but the principle ſhall be onely an humble love and gratitude, and the action ſhall be a true uſeful, and ingenious action, wherein ſome real ſervice ſhall be done for God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give an inſtance in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in that place laſt mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17, 18. a place where you have the Apoſtle doing two things, one of neceſſity, that had a wo upon it, if he did it not; ſo that whether he did it willingly or unwillingly, he muſt do it, and that was the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64817:110"/>preaching the Goſpel; the other purely volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and ſo free leſt him, that he might have done the contrary to what he did, and not have ſinned at all; and that was as to his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for preaching; he might have expected from them that they ſhould maintain him; but he would not, he would maintain himſelf; and this he took ſuch comfort in, that he calls this his glorying (as I take it) and he would rather dye, then that any man ſhould make this his glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void. Now the principle of this his action was not Legal, as if he thought by this to lay ſome obligation upon God, or his Lord Chriſt Jeſus; for he knew that he was ſo far obliged to the Lord for his mercies, that he could never lay an obligation upon God. The principle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was onely this of gratitude and nobleneſs; he had ſuch a good Maſter, that he could never do enough for; and therefore when he had ſent him to preach the Goſpel, which he muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably do, the Apoſtle ſpyed out an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of doing his duty herein more effectually, and that was, if he would preach the Goſpel upon free-coſt, though he was allowed by his Maſter to have demanded a reward; and now ſpying out this, how he might do an eminent ſervice, which yet was a free-will offering, he catches at it, and will rather dye then let go this opportunity. Ver. 5. <hi>It were better for me to dye, then that any man ſhould make my glorying void;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which take this paraphraſe of a learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator;
<q>
                  <hi>I have preached the Gospel on free-coſt, and would rather chooſe to famiſh by doing ſo, then be deprived of this way of advancing the Goſpel;</hi>
               </q> and <q>
                  <hi>I would not for all the world loſe this comfors and joy, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64817:110"/>I have preached to you,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>without receiving any thing from you.</hi> Here you ſee at the ſame time the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle can act from a principle of neceſſity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of voluntarineſs or nobleneſs; he preaches the Goſpel from the conſideration of a neceſſity, and he takes nothing for his preaching out of a principle of nobleneſs; and yet this ſecond ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is a real ſervice, and advantage to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; not ſuch a fooliſh thing as for men to whip themſelves, or to offer to the ſhrine of ſome Saint, or to ſay ſuch a tale of <hi>Pater noſters, &amp;c.</hi> That therefore is another Chriſtian Principle in acting for God, <hi>viz.</hi> Gratitude and Nobleneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely mention one more, and it is this, When one hath been uſed to ſerve God,
<note place="margin">The laſt and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is from the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the work it ſelf.</note> the wayes of God are ſo good in themſelves, that a man will find a great ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction in them; that they are the onely ways that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a mans nature, they are the only ways that are rational, he ſhall more and more ſee every ſin to be a groſs abſurdity, according to that Scriptuture, Heb. 5.14. <hi>Strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even thoſe, who by reaſon of uſe have their ſences exerciſed to diſcern good and evil:</hi> And believe it, this is an high attainment, to have a ſenſe of what is good and excellent, and of what is evil and baſe; and to love the firſt, and hate the latter for it ſelf; this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the very love and hatred that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath: Now though I have allowed that there are theſe three Goſpel-principles of Love and Gratitude, Nobleneſs and Generoſity, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and hating things for their own deſert, which men may arrive at; yet I dare not ſpeak a light word of the three firſt principles mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64817:111"/>eſpecially of that firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſerving God as our Creator, which I think wil be an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle of ſervice after we have received the fulleſt reward. And for thoſe principles of acting in hope of the reward, and to avoid Hell, I ſay firſt, as before, that they are good and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, nay Evangelical principles of action, and therefore cannot (ſimply conſidered) be reckoned for legal principles; yet perhaps I might ſay this, in agreement with thoſe that make them characters of a legal ſpirit, that if they could be diſcovered in any perſon to be the onely principle of action (as in <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> the avoiding the Judgements that they were ſenſible of to hang over them, were viſibly the onely motives of their religious acts) that perſon might be adjudged legal. But of this more when I come to ſpeak of a Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, which is the next Scripture-Character that <hi>I</hi> ſhall give of a Legal Spirit: Onely in the mean time <hi>I</hi> reckon that <hi>I</hi> have evinced that, taking it in the general, without that diſtinctneſs in which we are to proceed; ſo it is not a ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor any argument at all of a Legal Spirit to act towards God for fear of puniſhment, or in hope of the reward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> come now to a third Character of a Legal Spirit,
<note place="margin">The third Character of a Legal Spirit.</note> and it is this, To be under a Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, is an argument of a Legal Spirit. That this is an Argument or Character of a Legal Spirit, firſt let us ſee ſome Scripture-proof, and then <hi>I</hi> ſhall come to ſhew what a Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is. Now for Scripture-proof; <hi>I</hi> think there is no Character of a Legal Spirit plainer in the Scripture then this; <hi>I</hi> reckon indeed that the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64817:111"/>firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is external and fleſhly in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice of God, was a plain Scripture-Character; but <hi>I</hi> think this is rather plainer, in Gal. 4.22, 23. <hi>For it is written that Abraham had two ſons, the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman; but he who was of the bond-woman, was born after the FLESH, but he of the free-woman was by promiſe: which things are an Allegory; for theſe are the two Covenants. The one from Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>which gendreth to bondage, which is</hi> Hagar; This is the Law-Covenant: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> Legaliſts are under a ſpirit of Bondage, and they that are predominantly, or properly ſaid to be under a ſpirit of Bondage, are Legaliſts: the Propoſition is convertible, by reaſon that a ſpirit of Bondage is a property of a Legal ſpirit. Again, for a little more Scripture-proof: 1. 'Tis proved from its contrary; the ſpirit which is contrary to a ſpirit of Bondage, is a ſpirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption or Son-ſhip: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; now this Spirit of Adoption is a peculiar priviledge of the Goſpel; therefore the ſpirit of Bondage muſt belong to the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>For ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father;</hi> which I ſhall make bold to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe thus: Ye have not now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel received the ſpirit of Bondage again, as ye did under the Law (for ſome of theſe Romans to whom he writes, were Jews) but ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of Adoption, whereby both you and I, (for the perſon is changed) and all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Saints, cry <hi>Abba Father.</hi>

I am not ignorant that there is another interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation given of this Scripture by ſome, yet very agreeable with this that I here give, <hi>viz.</hi> That in every work of converſion there is a legal convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which they call a Spirit of Bondage, which goes before faith; and that after a man hath truely believed, he never receives, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to a ſpirit of Bondage again. But I think this is not the genuine interpretation; onely it may be allowed for true in a great meaſure: and I might borrow ſtrength from it for my preſent purpoſe; for that this ſpirit of Bondage in this interpretation, is the effect, or the work of the Law only; but of this the Reader may ſee more in the 41. page of the foregoing diſcourſe. I come now to ſhew what a ſpirit of Bondage is: now this diſcovers it ſelf in the very name Bondage or Slavery; as alſo by its oppoſition
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64817:112"/>to a ſpirit of Adoption or Son-ſhip; they that are under it ſerve not God as children ſerve a father, but as ſlaves ſerve a cruel maſter: again, it is notified to us by the inſeparable companion of this ſpirit, and that is fear; <hi>Ye have not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the spirit of bondage again to fear;</hi>

I ſhall give onely one Scripture more for this, that is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17, 18, 19. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of judgement, becauſe as he is</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>ſo are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love caſteth out fear: becauſe fear hath tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he that ſeareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> Here I collect and argue. We, that is, We Saints converted by the Goſpel, have all of us a principle of Love, which is quite contrary to that of fear. We ſhall have boldneſs in the day of Judgement; and this we have ſome fore-taſts of in this world; for that ſpirit which is oppoſed to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſpirit of Bondage to fear, is <gap reason="foreign">

But on the contrary, the Legal ſpirit hath no ſuch boldneſs in the preſence of God, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſilled with a tormenting fear and horrour at the thoughts of God; even as the Devils are in a great degree, who <hi>believe and tremble,</hi> and as

            </p>
            <p>Yet here I muſt needs acquaint the Reader that there is another expoſition of this Text, which I think, is very allowable, if not more genuine than the former, that is, that perfect love to God caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out all anxious and ſolicitous fear of ſuffering; and perſecution for God's Cauſe; I ſhall tranſcribe ſomwhat of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> upon the place, ver. 17. <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the day of Judgement—becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world;</hi> which he firſt thus tranſlates, In this the love with us is perfected, that we have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—and then paraphraſeth thus:
<q>In this the perfection of that love which is to be found in a Chriſtian conſiſts, that in a time of danger, when we are brought before Judges, and may probably loſe our lives for confeſſing of Chriſt, then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain courage and cheerfulneſs, and confeſs him willingly; that we behave our ſelves in this world as Chriſt did when he was here, that is, lay down our lives in teſtification of the truth; <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>there is no fear in love;</hi> that is, (ſaith he) ſuch love as this which was in Chriſt, hath no fear in it; Chriſt ventured and under-went the utmoſt, even death it ſelf for us.</q> I need tranſcribe no more: But
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64817:113"/>yet I think I may argue ſtrongly, even from this Expoſition, that which I aim at, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ſpirit is free from ſlaviſh fear of God, at leaſt in a great meaſure; for ſtill the love ſpoken of in this text, it is love to God; this love to God is a great Goſpel-principle, as appears in the text. Now can any bear a great love to any perſon, and yet have a ſlaviſh fear, a tormenting fear of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the ſame time? For my part, I think love and fear, with reſpect to the ſame perſon, are very near as oppoſite as love and hatred; and a torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſlaviſh fear of any perſon, cannot long be without a great degree of hatred: Is it not a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous queſtion in the Politiques concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of a Prince: <hi>An praeſtat timeri quam diligi?</hi> Whether it be more ſafe for a Prince to be loved or feared of his Subjects?

Again, take the Expoſition laſt given, that perfect love to God caſteth out all fear of men; it fills us with courage and reſolution, ſo that we are afraid of no ſufferings whatſoever: Yet is it poſſible that a man ſhould, from the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inflammedneſs of his love to God, be full of boldneſs and courage in the day of Judgement, that is, the day of hotteſt trials and perſecutions, fear nothing, becauſe it is for God, whom he loves dearly, and that for this very reaſon, that he loved him firſt, upon terms of gratitude; and yet that this man ſhould have his Spirit contracted and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the ſame time with a tormenting fear of the God for whom he ſuffers? I have argued before, that his love to God would not ſuffer ſuch a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64817:114"/>fear of God; I argue now, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion and enlargedneſs of heart and ſoul in his courage and boldneſs for God, is inconſiſtent with that contraction of ſpirit which a ſlaviſh fear of God at the ſame time muſt needs cauſe. A man that hath his ſpirit broken by the tormenting fear of God, can have no courage before men at all; <hi>Every man that meeteth me, will kill me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cain</hi> when a ſlaviſh terror of God had ſeized upon him. <hi>The ſinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Hypocrites,</hi> Iſa. 33.14. Why what is the matter? it follows: <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? Who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> When men have a ſenſe of the Wrath of God towards them, which is the cauſe of this ſlaviſh fear, it ſills them with fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and terror in all things elſe; they begin to be afraid of their own ſhadow. Therefore this boldneſs in the day of man's judgement here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, muſt ſuppoſe firſt, ſome boldneſs in the preſence of God; and ſo the ſenſe of the text runs clear. There is no fear in Love, where a man loves God heartily, and eſpecially out of a love of Gratitude, becauſe God loved him firſt, that ſoul hath boldneſs and courage in all his ſufferings: <hi>The Righteous is bold as a Lyon,</hi> Prov. 28.1. <hi>But the wicked fleeth when none purſueth: If God be for us,</hi> ſaith the good man, <hi>who can be againſt us? Who ſhall ſeparate us</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword, &amp;c. In all theſe things</hi> (and can there be greater in the day of man's Judgement) <hi>we are more then Conquerors, through him that loved
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64817:114"/>us,</hi> Rom. 8.35, 36. Here is a couragious, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Love; but whence is it ſpirited, but from the ſenſe of the Love of God. No ſoul preſſed with a ſlaviſh fear of God, could have uttered theſe triumphant expreſſions

               </note>.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt make a twofold diſtinction of fear, <hi>viz.</hi> in the kinds, and in the degrees of it.
<note place="margin">The firſt diſtinction of fear.</note> 1. In the kinds, there is a lawful and acceptable, yea neceſſary fear of God, and there is an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or at leaſt unacceptable fear of God. The firſt is, that awe we are to have of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty as we are creatures, and with which we are commanded <hi>to work out our own ſalvation even with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.22. This ſignifies no mor but the creature; keeping its due diſtance,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64817:115"/>knowing its place and condition of a creature, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a due ſence of the weighty concernment and importance of that ſalvation which we are to work out, conſidering the danger we eſcape, and the prize we preſs forward unto; theſe conſiderations make us greatly in earneſt; 'tis no trifling buſineſs we are about, and therefore we do it, and are to do it with fear and trembling, and greateſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant amongſt the <hi>Corinthians, in fear and great trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3. which, ſay Commentators, may ſignifie not onely his fear from perſecution, but thoſe which did ariſe from the conſideration of the greatneſs of his Work of ſaving ſouls. This fear now is lawful and commendable, and ſo far from being contrary to love as it may very well proceed from love; love to our ſelves, when we are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our ſalvation; and love to others when we are helping onward their ſalvation. But then there is a ſlaviſh fear of God in the ſpirits of men, which doth not further, but extreamly hinder the working out of their ſalvation. This fear we find in the ſloathful ſervant, that never ſet upon impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Maſters Talent, but laid it up in a Napkin, and when his Maſter called him to an account for his Talent, he tells his Maſter plainly what was the reaſon he never ſo much as endeavoured to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. <hi>For IFEARED thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe thou art an auſtere man; thou takeſt up that thou laideſt not down, and reapeſt that thou didſt not ſow. Lu.</hi> 19.21, 22. Thus every Legalliſt hath at the bottom of his heart, if not in his mouth (as this man in the parable hath) ſtrange prejudices and miſ-repreſentations of God, which beget ſlaviſh tormenting fear within him at the thoughts of God, and therefore may well be called, as it is moſt appoſitely, by the Apoſtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, looks ſo like that which is Divine and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, Now for all this which here I have tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed out of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> touching ſuperſtition, I reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it may be well applyed to the Legalliſt; and <hi>I</hi> ſhall not need to add any more in deſcribing their ſlaviſh fear of God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond diſtinction which I promiſed was of the degrees of fear,
<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of fear.</note> and this diſtinction is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very neceſſary, for that ſuch is the weakneſs of the Saints themſelves, that many of them may have a great degree even of ſlaviſh fear of God, and may be far gone under a Spirit of Bondage. The Saints of the Old-Teſtament by reaſon of the darkneſs of their diſpenſation, were, in a great
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64817:116"/>meaſure generally under this fear; and 'tis an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſome, (how ſolid I leave to others to judge) that therefore the Saints of the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are ſo commonly known by that Name, <hi>Such as feared the Lord,</hi> becauſe their diſpenſation was ſo legal and dark, and attended with a Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; but however that obſervation be cenſured, I am ſure the Apoſtle makes an aſſertion ſomewhat like it, In <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>That the heir as long as he is a Child, differeth nothing from a ſervant; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The ſenſe is this peremptorily; The true ſpiritual Seed, and heirs according to the Promiſe, had much of a ſpirit of bondage and fear in the dayes of the Old-Teſtament; and ſo ſtill it is very poſſible, and often found, that many true Saints, heirs of God, as then they differed, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> nothing, that is, nothing to ſpeak of; ſo now they differ but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, very little (ſuch is their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) from ſervants, by reaſon of the great mixtures of bondage and fear, which they have in their ſpirits in the ſervice of God; but yet now, though I have allowed this great mixture of a Spirit of bondage in the Saints, even to a great degree; yet I affirm, that now, and in all ages paſt, the Saints and wicked Legalliſts are to be diſcerned and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the one from the other by the degrees of this fear, as truly as before I diſtinguiſht them in the kinds of fear; for, as much as the Saints of God have, or may have of a ſlaviſh fear in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, yet they have all enough of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption and holy boldneſs, ſo as to over-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance it, and to enable them to cry, <hi>Abba,</hi> that is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A ſpirit of a ſlave was alwayes unacceptable unto God. The two Covenants (as I have ſhewn at large) were in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, and <hi>Abraham's</hi> time; and the one gendered to bondage, that was that from Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai;</hi> the other unto liberty, and that is from Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the <hi>Mother of us all</hi> that are, ſhall be, or ever were the true ſons and heirs of it; therefore they had always in a <hi>SUF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICIUNT DEGREE</hi> a ſpirit of liberty, of ſons, a ſpirit of adoption.</p>
            <p>Having made the ſpirit of bondage a Character, and given you the diſtinctions upon it, I ſhal brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the inſeparable connexion that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a legal ſpirit and it, and the very reaſon how it comes to paſs.
<note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable connexion between a ſpirit of bondage and a legal ſpirit.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it muſt needs be, that a legal ſpirit ſhould be attended with fear and terror; for his very way of ſerving God leads him into it. He goes to ſerve God, and to procure acceptance with him by the Works of the Law; now the Law (as <hi>I</hi> have ſhew nis of that nature that it cannot
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64817:118"/>juſtifie but where there is perfect, unerring obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and therefore to all that ſeek juſtification by it, and are not ſurniſhed with this obedience, it can onely prove a Miniſtration of death, terror, and deſperation: So that, let the Legalliſt fancy what he pleaſeth at firſt when he enters upon his way, as perhaps he may think to pleaſe God, and ſatisfie his own Conſcience with offering up ſome external ſervices, either ceremonious or moral, and never pretend to keep the whole law, and ſo not to ſeek juſtification in the true and proper way that the Law is to juſtifie; yet he ſhall find himſelf firſt reputed and reckoned amongſt thoſe that ſeek Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the Law, (as the <hi>Galatians</hi> were, who yet did not pretend to the proper righteouſneſs of the Law) and then he ſhall find in the next place, that becauſe of the imperfection of his obedience, the Law is too weak to juſtifie him, and yet it will ſtill ſhew him his duty, and preſs him to the doing of it, and it will diſcover his defects, and ſins, and the wrath due for them; but to allow ſtrength for the fulfilling it ſelf, or to procure pardon for any breach of it, this it cannot do; and ſo all the effects of the Law upon the Legalliſt, can be only to laſh, ſting and vex him, which muſt needs ſill his ſoul with horror and dread of that God whom hee ſerves.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>I</hi> ſhall not undertake to ſhew on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary how the very nature of the goſpel-way muſt needs produce peace, and an holy boldneſs and confidence in the ſight of God, though <hi>I</hi> might ſhew that out of the very way it ſelf theſe things would ſeem to ſpring; or at leaſt, that it is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and ſuitable to the goſpel-way of treating God, that it ſhould be accompanied with peace,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64817:119"/>joy and holy boldneſs in the preſence of God; for if the great and holy God wil admit any ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whilſt they remain in part ſinful, into fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and holy boldneſs with himſelf, who can they be other then thoſe that renounce all love to ſin, abhor themſelves by reaſon of ſin, and caſt themſelves for pardon and ſalvation purely upon his mercy and grace? All which <hi>I</hi> have ſhewn to be eſſential to the Evangelical or goſpel-way, the way of faith and grace which I am contending for, Beſides, we know the goſpel way of ſerving God receives a denomination from faith; it is called, the way of Faith; <hi>They that are OF FAITH are bleſſed with faithful Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3.9. Now if this way hath ſo much of faith in it, (which we know hath affiance in its notion) that Faith ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to give name to this way, as it doth, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this way cannot want an holy boldneſs and confidence in it.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of inſiſting upon this way of proof from the very nature and conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: I ſhall content my ſelf with a few more Scripture-proofs beſides what I firſt mentioned in the entrance of this Character, to ſhew that peace, joy and holy boldneſs in the preſence of God, are great effects of a Goſpel-way of ſerving God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the SPIRIT is love, joy, peace, &amp;c.</hi> By the ſpirit is meant either the goſpel, or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt, which is conveighed by it, or that better part which is within us, called ſo in oppoſition to the Fleſh: or if you will all three, and then the ſenſe is this, The Spiritual, or New-nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, brought forth by the Holy Ghoſt, in the preaching of the Goſpel hath ſuch fruits as theſe; Love, Joy, Peace, &amp;c. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64817:119"/>of God,</hi> that is, <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> where it comes in power, <hi>is not meat and drink,</hi> that is, it conſiſts not of theſe chiefly, if at all; <hi>but it is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt;</hi> theſe are the great deſigns and effects of the Goſpel. And we know that the Goſpel is the great miniſtration of the Spirit who is given in the Goſpel as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, as an earneſt of the inheritance, as an Advocate</hi> within us, <hi>teaching us to cry Abba Father.</hi> It were endleſs to give all the places which make for the proof of this propoſition, that the Goſpel hath great joys and comforts attending it; and that the oppoſite way to it of ſerving God, which is by the Law, can have no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be here objected, that it's ſtrange,
<note place="margin">Obj.</note> if the Goſpel-way be ſo full of comfort and boly boldneſs in the preſence of God, ſo attended with the Spirit of Adoption, as you have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there ſhould be ſo many ſad, drooping, deſponding Saints as there are, that though they live holily, and we cannot but think they are good men, yet are not acquainted with any of thoſe comforts, durſt not call God Father, are full of fears and doubts touching the favour of God towards them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that this is a conſiderable objection:

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Setting aſide what may be of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſpenſation in the troubles of ſome Saints, I think it's generally their own fault that they have no more comfort and conſidence than they have. God would have us rejoice, <hi>Rejoice is the Lord alwaies, and again I ſay, rejoice,</hi> Phil. 4.4. <hi>Rejoice evermore,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.16.

But there are ſeveral ways by which the Saints may, and many do deprive themſelves of comfort; by falling into ſins, which to be ſure will break their peace, or elſe by admitting Satans ſubtilties againſt their peace, hearkening to all the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64817:120"/>whiſpers of the Serpent againſt themſelves, who ſometimes tells them they are not elected; at other times, that they have committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; another time, that they have out-ſtood the day of grace, or that the ſpirit of God is departed from them; and theſe things I believe many that have the Spirit of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, have not out-ſtood their day of grace, much leſs committed the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, may yet call into queſtion, and hear Satans ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about them ſo long, till they be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect maze and labyrinth of thoughts, doubts and fears; ſo that, except the Lord ſhould bring them our by a Miracle almoſt, I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how they ſhould get out: This fear and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror therefore was from their own fauſt at firſt, though now they cannot help themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Yet ſtill I think it may be aſſerted, that even for theſe very perſons concerning whom the objection is made, and which are mentioned in the laſt particular, that even theſe when they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and have the right uſe of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (for I reckon that ſuch ſad ſouls paſs through many <hi>deliriums,</hi> and irrational imaginations) have all of them more kindly ſtrains of ingenuity to God, and of filial boldneſs, than any Legalliſt in the world ever hath; they have their <hi>lucida intervalla,</hi> the ſmiles of God ſometimes, and feel the ſupports of the everlaſting Arms; or if they have not that which you may call comfort, yet at leaſt they are enabled to act towards God with a better ſpirit then that of a ſlave</p>
            <p n="5">5. But for others that are not thus; and I hope I may ſay, the greater part of true Saints they have a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64817:121"/>comfort and joy in the ſervice of God, and their hearts are mightily lightened and quickned by it: <hi>Thy word</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>is ſweeter to me then the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And certainly, if the joy of the Goſpel be ſuch as will carry us thorough the greateſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it may well carry us thorough all the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affairs and occaſions of this life: Yet for this ſee one place in the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> ch. 9.7, 8. <hi>Go thy way, eat thy Bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart;</hi> why ſo? it follows, <hi>for now God accepteth thy works;</hi> When a man's ways pleaſe the Lord, and he hath a ſenſe of it (which none but a Goſpel-Saint ever hath) it will make him go chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully through all the actions and occaſions of his life. Now if there be ſuch a general joy upon the true Saints of God, ariſing from their Goſpel-way of ſerving God, as will carry them through ſufferings, and through all the actions of their lives, and by conſequence into the preſence of God with a chearfulneſs and holy boldneſs; is it not moſt injurious, that the troubles and ſadneſs of a few Saints, brought upon themſelves againſt the deſign of the Goſpel, through the ſubtilties of Satan, and the Saints own default, ſhould be thought able to make this aſſertion too light, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Goſpel-ſpirit hath an holy boldneſs and a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64817:121"/>chearfulneſs in it, and is freed from the Spirit of bondage (which accompanies a Legal Spirit) into the glorious liberty of ſon-ſhip and adoption.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely make one obſervation more before I paſs off from the explication and proof of this Character, which I think will add ſome light unto it, and it will be of a very contrary nature from the obſervation which the objection faſtens upon, and it is this.</p>
            <p>It hath been laid to the charge of the <hi>Puritans, that they are too familiar with God in their Prayers:</hi> Now truly I will not undertake to defend <hi>thoſe good men that have been honoured with that Name,</hi> in every thing; but I think in this particular, (as in many other things) they have a great excellency, in that they know better than their adverſaries, how to uſe an holy boldneſs at the throne of grace. And yet to ſhew that I am not altogether ſenſleſs of the danger that there is of erring this way, I do here acquaint my Reader that I verily believe, that many have groſly erred herein: I have heard of one very famous once in <hi>London,</hi> a Tradeſman, that being gotten in a Pulpit, made thus bold with the great God in prayer, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid, O Lord, that concerning thy ſons, and concerning thy daughters, we ſhould command thee: we command thee therefore, &amp;c:</hi> I need not go to aggravate this boldneſs: I have heard others my ſelf, unreaſonably (as I thought) bold in their expreſſions in prayer; but I dare not charge this upon thoſe good people in the general, which have been called <hi>Puritans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am ſure however it is with them in one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, it is as bad and worſe with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and thoſe that are ſuperſtitiouſly addicted in the other, that they dare not uſe that holy boldneſs which is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64817:122"/>allowed them, nay, which is neceſſary to be uſed. They think it too great a boldneſs to go to God in prayer without the mediation and interceſſion of ſome Saint or Angel; or if they go to the right Mediator, they dare not go to him but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> all which are but over-ſervile fears, and denials to themſelves of that true liberty and boldneſs which the Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us unto. If they go to celebrate the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, the Supper or Feaſt of Chriſt's body &amp; blood, which we are to eat and to drink at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for our ſouls health, firſt the people muſt not have the Wine; then the Bread muſt be carryed about, and worſhipped like a god; the Table upon which it is conſecrated, muſt be an Altar; it muſt not be received, but upon your knees; nor taken, as the command is, <hi>Take eat;</hi> but received from the Prieſts hand into your mouths, which are all but ſo many ſuperſtitious and ſervile uſages of that Ordinance, which all ought to have an holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in, and is not at all prejudiced, but rather fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered as to Divine acceptance, by how much the more of diſcreet and judicious boldneſs we have in the uſe of it: And here I ſhall take liberty to ſay ſomething to the nature of Superſtition, which I ſhall preſently have done with, and ſo paſs on to the application of this Character.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhal take liberty to ſay ſomething to the nature of Superſtition, having (as I reckon) a fair occaſion for it; and yet I ſhall quickly have done with it, and ſo paſs on to the application <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the Character.</p>
            <p>Superſtition therefore (which I humbly offer) either conſiſts in, or ariſeth from an overcimorous and dreadful apprehenſion of the Deity. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:64817:122"/>of <hi>Cambridge</hi> whom I have ſo often mentioned, with thoſe other great Authors which he quotes, ſeems to make that the onely notion of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, that it is an overtimorous apprehenſion of God: Now I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s reaſons, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Arguments and Authority of thoſe whom he quotes, may very well ſerve to make that notion of Superſtition to paſs as a true notion, though not the onely notion of Superſtition; though indeed Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in that Diſcourſe partly reproves <hi>Cicero</hi> for tranſlating the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by <hi>Superſtitio;</hi> but allowing this for a true notion of Superſtition: Yet Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in the ſame Diſcourſe mentions two others, one of which he calls a gloſs of the late Ages impoſition, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a too-ſtrict confining it to <hi>Polytheiſme.</hi> This laſt being by the Author intimated to be Mr. <hi>Mede's</hi> (as I ſuppoſe) or Dr. <hi>Hammoud's;</hi> the other that which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> or Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath confuted, or freed the Word from. Now Mr. <hi>Mede's,</hi> or the learned Author of our age (as he ſpeaks) his noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Superſtition is this; I ſhall give it in Mr. <hi>Smith's</hi> own words; <hi>He ſeems</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to have too ſtrictly confined it to a cowardly-worſhip of the ancient Gentile-Daemons, as if Superſtition and Polytheiſm were indeed the ſame thing; whereas Polytheiſm or Daemon-worſhip is but one branch of it.</hi> Now this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, <hi>viz.</hi> a worſhipping the Superſtites (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it that name, as Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> doth) I take to be a Superſtition that ariſeth from an overtimor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apprehenſion of the Deity; but doth not ſo much <hi>conſiſt in it;</hi> for they that are guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo many Mediators with God, do it chiefly for this reaſon, for that they have ſuch a dreadful apprehenſion of God, that they think they may
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64817:123"/>not dare to come and pray to him without thoſe Mediators, nor to Chriſt himſelf without the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of his bleſſed Mother.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>neſs the Author intimated by Mr <hi>Smith,</hi> to be Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> is, for that he makes great uſe of the buſineſs of <hi>Daemon</hi>-worſhip, and by it proves the <hi>Papiſts</hi> highly guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for worſhipping of Saints, which he parallels with <hi>Gentile-Daemons;</hi> though at the ſame he be for many of thoſe things which ſome in theſe LATE AGES have thought Superſtitious, as the holineſs of Churches the Supper of the Lord to be called a Sacrifice, the Table to be called the Altar, &amp;c. Now this I ſuppoſe is that Superſtition, or that which by the latter ages impoſition is called Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and is ſaid by Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to be confuted out of the Name by Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> or that learned Author of our own. Now I muſt confeſs I have taken the Word Superſtition in this ſenſe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſeveral places of my Diſcourſe, herein being in the miſtaken notion (it ſeems) of the late ages about what is Superſtition. And I muſt needs ſay, I take Superſtition to be <hi>the placing a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in things which will not admit of it, and where it ought not to be,</hi> as in the differences of meats, which once had a Religion in their obſervance; but now have not, and cannot have; in kneeling at the Sacrament, in bowing to the Altar, in the croſs in Baptiſin, and all ceremonious obſervances, more than what are naturally decent, ſuch as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and kneeling, or at leaſt ſtanding at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for Image-Worſhip, or <hi>Daemon</hi>-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. I call that rather Idolatry, then Superſtition: For Superſtition I take to be <hi>a vice in the leſſer things of worſhip;</hi> and I am ſure if they will not
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64817:123"/>allow us this word to ſignifie this vice, we muſt have another word to call it by, for ſuch a vice there is; <hi>Ye obſerve dayes, and months, and times, and years, I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed upon you labour in vain,</hi> Gal. 4.10, 11. <hi>Let no man judge you in meat or in drink, or in reſpect of an holy day; or of the new Moon, or of the Sabbath-dayes,</hi> Col. 2.16. and in <hi>Mark</hi> 7.2, 3, 4. we find, that <hi>the Phariſees, and ALL the Jews, except they waſh their heads oft, eat not, holding the TRADITIONS OF THE EL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS, and when they come from the Market, except they waſh, they eat not; and many other things there be which they have RECEIVED TO HOLD, as the waſhing of Cups and Pots, brazen Veſſels, and of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> in theſe Scriptures is ſuch a vice taxed, as <hi>I</hi> call ſuperſtition, that is, the placing Religion where God hath not placed it, and would not have it placed. And I could never yet learn that there was ſo much ſignificancy in the Etymology of that word, that they need be ſo curious, and I may ſay ſuperſtitious in keeping it from this hone uſe that the late ages would have put it to; and as I have obſerved Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> makes bold to carp at <hi>Cicero</hi> for tranſlating <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by it, for ſo <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>frequently tranſlatos that word, though not ſo fitly and emphatically as he hath done ſome others.</hi> Now ſince <hi>Cicero</hi> ſeems to have tranſlated it unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the late ages have made perhaps a more fit, at leaſt a ſitting uſe of the word; why may not their uſing it recommend it to us, eſpecially when it is ſo well underſtood in their uſe of it; but let become of the word what wil, taking it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>there is ſuch a vice as placing Religion in things where it ought not.</hi> I ſhall onely ſhew how this ariſeth from an over-timorous apprehenſion of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64817:124"/>Deity; ſuperſtitious men wanting the right notion of God, that he is a Spirit, and looks chiefly at the heart, and that he is good and merciful, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more of his crevture then what he can well and comfortably perform;</hi> they are apt to think that God is upon the catch (as we ſay) with them, and ſtands upon punctilio's, and therefore they muſt be very exact and ceremonious in every thing that they do for him; and hence ſeem to have ſprung all theſe uſeleſs ceremonies, and ſuperſtitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in the ſervice of God. The Phariſees muſt be ſo clean and pure, that they muſt waſh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; when they faſt, they muſt dis-figure their very faces. The <hi>Coloſſians</hi> muſt be ſo obſervant, that they muſt not <hi>touch, taſte</hi> or <hi>handle,</hi> Col. 2.22. The Laity amongſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> muſt not taſte the Wine, it is too good for them; nor touch the Wafer (which is ſuperſtitiouſly invented inſtead of Bread) with their unhallowed hands, but receive it into their mouths from the hand of the Prieſt, and that upon their knees; yea, when the Hoſt is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the ſtreets, they muſt fall down upon their knees.</p>
            <p>Thus I have diſpatched this obſervation about ſuperſtitious mens ſhineſs of God in his Worſhip, that they have not that holy boldneſs they ought to have, but a ſpirit of bondage and of ſlaves in the preſence of God. Superſtitious men under any of the three notions of Superſtition, are under a ſpirit of bondage in the ſervice of God. I come now to the application of the Character.</p>
            <p>And in this I ſhall proceed (as I have done in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Characters) firſt indeavouring hence to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Predominant,
<note place="margin">The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Character.</note> then Partial Legality, or the mixtures of Legality in the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:64817:124"/>Now for Predominant Legality, as the notions of Superſtition have been ſeverally given and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, Superſtition alone may ſerve to diſcover where this great evil is. As Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> gives the notion of Superſtition, it ſeems to me to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the ſpirit of Bondage it ſelf; and I dare ſay, if thou art ſuperſtitious in his ſenſe, thou art under a ſpirit of bondage Predominantly, and ſo under Legality Predominant. If thou lookeſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God as a Tyrant, and yet ſerveſt him, and that as ſuch, what higher deſcription can there be of a ſpirit of Bondage.</p>
            <p>Hither I might refer all the too-ſevere penances which the Papiſts inflict upon themſelves, in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſtings, and ſcourging of themſelves; as if the merciful God were taken with ſuch crueties inſtead of true worſhip and devotion. But becauſe I have often touched upon theſe things already, I ſhall forbear, though this be the moſt proper head of this matter: Neither yet am I an enemy to pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent penances (if I may ſo call them) that is means and trials of one's mortification and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſo they be wiſely directed to an end; as for the Intemperate to faſt, to afflict his ſoul and body before God; for thoſe that are apt to be proud in apparel, to deny themſelves ſometimes the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryliberties of apparel, and perhaps to wear very mean cloaths, that they may break themſelves of their proud humour. I make no doubt if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould give us the inſtances of his mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he <hi>kept under his body</hi> (that is, his whole ſelf, though it may be his body in eſpecial manner) <hi>and brought it into ſubjection,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. (the words are <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64817:125"/>my ſelf a ſervant</hi>) I ſay, if he ſhould tel us what courſes he took in his mortification, what liberties he denyed himſelf, what tasks he might poſſibly impoſe upon himſelf, I doubt it would make moſt of us condemn our ſelves ſeverely for daſtardly and effeminate Chriſtians; but yet ſtil (I doubt not but his abſtinencies and impoſitions were rational, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed to an end, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſubdue or keep under ſome paſſion, or the like end) he did not (ſure) ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelf, or reckon that God was pleaſed with his ſufferings, further then as they were a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice.</p>
            <p>So again for the ſecond notion of Superſtition, thou Idolater, thou Papiſt, that canſt not come to the great God without a falſe Mediator, through a fear and ſhineſs, I have no comfort for thee; onely that I know not how merciful God may be to an erronious Conſcience, whenas the perſons other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (ſetting aſide their error) are ſincere and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial in their obedience, and hold the Head, that is, Chriſt, as the Apoſtles phraſe is, 2 <hi>Col.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>Again, for them that are ſuperſtitious in the laſt and loweſt, though (I ſhould think) propereſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word, and are groſly ſo, I take it as a very ſhrewd ſign of a Spirit of Bondage, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality predominant, not onely for this reaſon, that they plainly diſcover themſelves to be very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Goſpel, by which all the Ceremonial Law was at once laid aſide, and no other ſubſtituted by the Apoſtles, nor (as I ſhould think) left to be invented by their corrupter ſucceſſors; but for that other reaſon which I mentioned, for that ſuch men that are ſo much for invented Ceremonies, which I reckon ſuperſtitious, are not onely <hi>de facto,</hi> ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to a Spirit of Prayer, (which is all one with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64817:125"/>the ſpirit of adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.) but muſt needs ſet upon the inventing or embraciag theſe ſuperſtitions, for that they think certainly the great God obſerves as much the little circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are not indeed to be deſpiſed) as the ſubſtance of every action; and that if you are not mighty exact in every punctilio, the Lord will not accept the moſt ſincere devotion; and hence they came to <hi>ſerve out</hi> every action with ſo much pomp and ceremony as muſt needs hinder the performance of ſome other neceſſary duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the inventions are many times ſinful in themſelves: Or elſe there muſt be another reaſon of theſe ſuperſtitious inventions, which Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſuggeſts, and thereby methinks, brings down his high notion of Superſtition ſomewhat towards this laſt that we have given; his words are, <hi>That ſuperſtitious men think, though God is apt to be angry, yet that he is eaſily to be appeaſed again by ſome FLATTERING DEVOTIONS, eſpecially if performed with ſanctimonious ſhews, and a ſolemn ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind;</hi> and therefore (ſaith he) <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will alwayes abound in theſe things, whereby this Deity of their own, made after the ſimilitude of men, may be moſt gratified, ſlaſiſhly crouching to it:</hi> And then quotes <hi>Plutarch</hi> taxing the <hi>Jews</hi> with their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>their wallowings in the duſt, tumblings in the mire, proſternations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth geſtures, and ſtrange rites of worſhip;</hi> the very things which we call Superſtition, bowing to the high Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again he tells us, That <hi>this root of Superſtition diverſly brancheth forth it ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into poedantical rites, and idle obſervations of things and times:</hi> What is it that the lave ages have
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64817:126"/>called Superſtition, but this, which here Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> acknowledgeth to be the effects or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Superſtition?</p>
            <p>But to let paſs this criterion of Superſtition, as to the word, but yet retaining the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it, which is an over-timorous fear of God, we may find out predominant Legality by this that follows: Art thou engaged in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God ONELY through the fear of Hell? What ſaiſt thou to that Scripture, <hi>The ſinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulneſs harh ſurprized the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: Who among us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? Who among us ſhall dwel with everlaſting burnings? Iſa.</hi> 33.14. Not as if this principle were in it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; no, it is a Goſpel-principle; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, (as I have ſhewed) makes uſe of it, when he ſayes, <hi>I beat down my body, leſt after I have preached the Goſpel to others, I myſelf ſhould be a caſt-away:</hi> But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in conjunction with it; <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> (ſaith he) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed before, that fear of Hell, acting for the reward, or from a principle of natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, theſe are not Legal principles in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in their own nature; ſo that he that acts by them, ſhould be far judged to be Legal; but onely, they are ſuch as may want the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of other principles not to make themſelves paſs for Evangelical, but to make the perſon that acts by them, enough Evangelical; they are a lower ſort of good principles, which, let them have as great influence as they will, can do no hurt; onely there muſt be ſomewhat more, ask ſhewed above; and indeed here is the proper place to ſhew the neceſſity of ſome further prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64817:126"/>and I accordingly promiſed in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to ſhew it in this. Now I ſuppoſe this is is the great reaſon why there is need of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle beſides thoſe three, for that a man may act by all thoſe three principles, and yet be under a Spirit of Bondage. Now there muſt be ſome principle to free the ſoul from this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or elſe the ſoul can never ſerve God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably: This Principle muſt be Love; <hi>Perfect love caſteth out fear;</hi> firſt, all ſlaviſh fear of God, then the fear of men; <hi>he that feareth, is not made perfect in love: Look to what degree the love of God is in the ſoul, to ſuch degree is the ſlaviſh fear of God, and the cowardly fear of men abated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet take two cautions in examining thy ſelf by this Character, as to predominant Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 1. Be not too raſh in concluding thou haſt no love to God. 2. If thou thinkeſt thou haſt reaſon to conclude that hitherto thou haſt no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle of action towards God, but thoſe three, which do not neceſſarily exclude a ſpirit of Bondage; yet be not diſcouraged as to the future; thou mayeſt have a further principle; thou art in the faireſt way towards it that any other is; <hi>A spirit of Bondage is far better than a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane spirit:</hi> Many Divines hold (and I think rightly) that the Lord in the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, doth uſually lead men through a ſpirit of bondage, into a ſpirit of adoption; though thou ſhouldſt be at preſent (as to thy ſtate) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, yet the Law is a School-Maſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt: And Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in that ſo often quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Diſcourſe of Superſtition, tells us, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quoted that very place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid; who ſhall dwell with the devouring
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64817:127"/>fire?</hi> as an argument of men under the power of Superſtition: <hi>though I ſhould not diſlike</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſe dreadful and aſtoniſhing thoughts of future tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I doubt GOOD MEN may have cauſe to preſs home upon their own ſpirits, whilſt they find IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENUITY leſs active.</hi> Thou ſeeſt there may be good uſe of ſuch principles even in good men, therefore they are not bad in thee.</p>
            <p>But I come to the diſcovery of partial Legaity, or the mixtures of Legality which may be found in the ſervice and ſpirits of good men, from this Character. And this is indeed the Character by which the Legality of good men is uſually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, There are many Saints (as I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated already ſeveral times) who, though they walk very exactly, are not conſcious to themſelves of living in any known ſin; nay, it is known by all that know them intimately, that they are very ſtrict in their lives, yet theſe are ſtill in doubts and fears touching their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they are ſorely affraid that the Lord is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and diſpleaſed with them; though they have no reaſon from the Scriptures, or from the judgment of other Chriſtians and Miniſters, nor from any revelation within them, but onely through Satans temptations: Now theſe men cannot gather their fears from any other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or reaſon, then from their unreaſonable conceptions, their over-timorous and dreadful apprehenſions of God. They have ſome ſecret fears and doubts of his goodneſs, that he will never be pleaſed, though they make their way never ſo perfect before him; though they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves, though they acknowledge their vileneſs in never ſo great debaſements and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrencies
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64817:127"/>of themſelves. The truth is, they are ſecretly afraid, and it muſt be ſo (or elſe their jealouſies muſt be without ſo much as the leaſt ſhew of reaſon) that they ſhall never pleaſe God, unleſs they keep the Law to a tittle; and what is Legality if this be not? that is, they think ſo at ſome times (and this occaſions their fears and doubts) not that they think ſo always, for if they ſhould think ſo alwayes, they were perfect Legalliſts. Or elſe if they do not think ſo high as this, that they muſt keep the whole law, yet they think at leaſt, that they muſt do ſome very great thing which is beyond their ſtrength; And ſo accordingly for inſtance, they think they muſt do ſo many duties in a day, let what buſineſs come that can come; and they muſt do it ſo well, be they in never ſo ill a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or frame of heart, (not as if our ill temper excuſeth the ill performance of an action, where that diſtemper is brought upon us by ourſelves) and that they perhaps muſt do as much, when they are ſick, as when they are well; that though they be weak in grace, or weak in parts, that yet they muſt do as much as thoſe that are ſtrong in both. All this now, together with the fears and troubles that attend theſe thoughts, I call Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and it proceeds from a falſe and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timorous apprehenſion of the Deity. And they are not enough ſenſible, that the condition of man is altered from perfect to imperfect; nor that the terms betwixt the great God and his creature Man are altered from Legal to Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical: And I ſay once for all, he that thinks God requires any thing of the Creature above its ſtrength; nay beyond what the creature can
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64817:128"/>(through the grace of God) well and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perform, is a Legalliſt, and under the ſpirit of bondage ſo far. That is certainly a general Goſpel-maxime, though made uſe of upon a particular occaſion of contribution to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Saints, which we have 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> And nothing is plainer in the Scripture then this, That the Lord will proceed in his taking account of us according to the proportion of Talents that he put into our hands. As many as have ſinned without Law, ſhal alſo periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law; and as many as have ſinned in the Law, ſhal be judged by the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. The Lord wil not expect more then four talents from him to whom he gave but two, nor more then two from him to whom he gave but one, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15, 20, 21, 22. and from the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſick he expects not the ſame that he doth from him when he is in health; nor from a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man the ſame, as to acts of devotion, that he doth from the unmarried Perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.32.33.</p>
            <p>Now this I dare not let paſs without theſe cautions. 1. That I have delivered this onely for the comfort of thoſe that are apt to accuſe and cenſure themſelves unreaſonably; not for any looſe-principled people, who are ready to ſay, <hi>They do all they can, and God is merciful.</hi> 2. That this Doctrine, that God proceeds according to the proportions of talents entruſted with us, is not more comfortable to ſome, than terrible to others. You that have great parts, and great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, cannot be ſaved with the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64817:128"/>that others may; if he that had five talents, had brought in but ſix or ſeven to his Maſter, he could no more have entred into the joy of his Lord, then he that laid up his one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a Napkin, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.20, 21. Or at leaſt he ſhould enter difficultly, and with great loſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p>Now as there may be theſe unreaſonable fears and doubts about their ESTATE in the hearts of the Saints, which is ſo much of a ſpirit of bondage, for that <hi>all unreaſonable fears of God are the effects and univocal proper productions of a spirit of bondage:</hi> I ſay, as there may be theſe fears as to their ſtate and condition, ſo there may be as to PARTICULAR ACTIONS, an abſurd fear that we may not do them, and a guilt after we have done them, when indeed they were lawful to be done; which uſually argues a ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and ſo a legal ſpirit in theſe actions: Yet I will acknowledge, that to do actions, though lawful, with a doubting mind makes them ſins, and may <hi>juſtly</hi> affect us with a guiltineſs. But many times one does an action freely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting, and afterwards with a ſcrupuloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reflects upon the action, and then hath a fear and a guilt: Now I ſay, if this action upon which we reflect thus, was a lawful action, then is our guilt and fear which we have impreſſed upon us, an argument of Legality, or a Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, for the reaſon above given.</p>
            <p>But yet there is ſomething more to be ſaid as to the clearing of this matter; for I will not dare to call all cautious, wary proceeding, in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingout what may, or may not be the wil of God, and my duty in ſuch or ſuch an action, to call
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64817:129"/>call this Legality, and the effect of a ſpirit of bondage: God forbid! this were Doctrine for a Ranter to vent, not for any ſober perſon. But this is that which I affirm, That we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire faithfully and ſeriouſly what may be our duty, and what may be our liberty in ſuch or ſuch an action, before we adventure upon it; and if we cannot underſtand ſuch a thing to be our liberty, as for inſtance, to take uſury-money, to take an oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ought not to do it; but yet I ſay, (and that is the chief thing I intend in this particular) that if we determine againſt our own liberty, it not onely argues a weakneſs of judgement, but uſually a ſpirit of bondage, for that our very determination proceeds from a falſe opinion, and an over-timorous apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God: We think that he will not allow his ſervants ſuch liberties as indeed he doth; we think him an hard Maſter, as it is <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.25.</p>
            <p>There are ſome men whom I dare not but think good men, that yet think a Chriſtian, a Saint of God, ſhould be ſo exact, ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in things that are of no conſideration; ſo ſuperſtitious (I may ſay) in geſtures, habits, language, as if a Chriſtian, when once ſuch, were not to converſe with other men, but <hi>muſt go out of the world,</hi> as the Apoſtles phraſe is, ſpeaking in ſuch a caſe as this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10. And theſe men I make no doubt, have done much prejudice to Religion by their great reſervedneſs and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of principles, which I ſhall take liberty here to call Legality, and a ſpirit of bondage, for that it uſually proceeds from a wrong appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of God, as if he were hard and auſtere, and cruel to his creatures. And this narrowneſs
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64817:129"/>of ſpirit and ſcrupuloſity, hath been a common and powerful principle in people, ſo long, till at laſt it hath iſſued out in a party and faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; and it is (as I conceive) one of the moſt conſiderable ingredients in their Religion whom we call <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with this third Character: I come now to a fourth, which is this:</p>
            <p>A Legal ſpirit is a perſecuting ſpirit, and that eſpecially of thoſe that are the true Goſpel-Saints and Worſhippers of God; I ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give my Scripture for this, it is in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28, 29. <hi>Now we, Brethren, as Iſaac was, are children of the promiſe; but as then, he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the spirit, even ſo it is now.</hi> He that is born after the fleſh was the ſon of the Bond woman, from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by works, as all the Allegory wil wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, eſpecially ver. 23. he that is born after the ſpirit, is the ſon of the promiſe, that reſts upon the promiſe in the Goſpel-way for Juſtification. Now as there have always been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe two ſeeds, theſe two ſorts of Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; ſo there was alwayes an enmity between them; and they that are after the fleſh, and for the Law, alwayes perſecuted them that are for the Goſpel; thoſe that are for the Law, are ful of perſecuting principles againſt all that differ from them; they would fain have all forced to be of their way; but yet their perſecution is moſt fiercely directed againſt the true Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; they cannot endure that they ſhould live upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:64817:130"/>Cain was a right Legalliſt; he brings of the fruit <hi>of the ground an offering unto the Lord;</hi> but never minds with what heart he offers it; yet takes it for granted that God would accept of it, and like it very well: And when he finds that his offering is not accepted, and that his younger Brother's is, he cannot bear it, he hates his Brother, and longs for the blood of his Brother; and wherefore flew he him? ſaith the Scripture; Alas! for no other reaſon is the anſwer made in the ſame place, but for that <hi>his own works were evil,</hi> and rejected, <hi>and his Brothers righteous</hi> and accepted, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.12. not that his Brother had done him the leaſt wrong imaginable.</p>
            <p>Wherefore did <hi>Iſhmael</hi> (the ſon of the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman) perſecute <hi>Iſaac,</hi> (which perſecution we find not to be other than ſcoffing at him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9.) but onely becauſe he was the ſon of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? mocking him perhaps with ſome ſuch taunt as this, There goes a young Puritan, a young Preciſian, the Son of the promiſe.</p>
            <p>But come we down to the New-Teſtament; and who (there) are the great perſecutors of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apoſtles, but the <hi>Jews?</hi> yet who greater Legalliſts then they? They at <hi>Lyſtra</hi> that would have worſhipped <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabus</hi> for gods to day, are by to morrow perſwaded by ſome <hi>Jews</hi> that came down thither from <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Iconium,</hi> to ſtone them, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.11.19. They were the <hi>Jews</hi> who were ſo zealous for the Law, that cryed out againſt <hi>Paul, Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth, it is not fit that he ſhould live, Acts</hi> 22.22. Might not he juſtly therefore, as he doth, (not by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but of right appellation) call them Dogs,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64817:130"/>
               <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the conciſion;</hi> thoſe that yet have their great confidences in the fleſh, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.4. And as it was then in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, and in the Apoſtles days, ſo it is now; they that are for Ceremonies and Superſtitions, or meerly for an external way of ſerving God, cannot endure the true ſpiritual Worſhippers.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now in a word endeavour to ſhew how this ſpirit of perſecution proceeds from their Legality; not that the Law teacheth them any ſuch thing <hi>directly;</hi> but that the corruption of their ſpirits incited <hi>occaſionally</hi> from the Law, puts them upon it. Now I ſuppoſe it comes to paſs thus, that ſeeing they are in ſuch a way of ſerving God, as brings them in no true peace, but puts the moſt of them into great horrors, fears, and troubles of ſpirit, as is manifeſted in the former particular, and indeed into a ſecret hatred of God; they cannot vent their hatred againſt God directly, that would be too groſs; and therefore they find out ſome pretence or other of venting it againſt his trueſt and moſt faithful ſervants: They'l accuſe them of being too ſtrict, that they are the troublers of their <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>Elijah</hi> was accuſed by <hi>Ahab.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.17. though indeed <hi>Elijah</hi> there ſets the Saddle upon the right Horſe, (as the proverb is) when he tells <hi>Ahab,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>I have not troubled Iſrael; but thou and thy fathers Houſe, in that ye have forfaken the Commandments of the Lord, and thou haſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Baalim.</hi> So was his ſucceſſor <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſerved by the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his time, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. where is a moſt pertinent ſtory to this purpoſe, which I hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſomewhat touched at above. There was
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64817:131"/>indeed a ſore Famine in <hi>Samaria,</hi> perhaps upon the prayer of <hi>Eliſha</hi> (as before there was upon the prayer of <hi>Elijah,</hi> as appears from 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.1. compared with <hi>James</hi> 5.17, 18.) or at leaſt the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuſpected that he was the cauſe of it, and upon this bears him a grudge; but yet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> promiſing, or giving ſome hopes at leaſt that there ſhould be a plenty in ſome very ſhort time (as Commentators ſay) the King thinks fit to wait a while, which he in the 33. ver. <hi>calls wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Lord;</hi> and he waits with ſome ſigns of humiliation; for it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 30 that at the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the womans eating her child, <hi>he rent his cloaths, and the people looked, and behold he had ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath within upon his fleſh:</hi> And he hath ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious words for thoſe that came to make their complaint to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 26.27. <hi>Then cryed a woman unto him ſaying, Help my Lord, O King; And he ſaid, If the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee?</hi> Hitherto all things look pretty well; but alas! this was all but an external religiouſneſs, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal humiliation, like that of wicked <hi>Ahab; Seeſt thou Ahab humbleth himſelf?</hi> And therefore this King's forced patience hath an end, and he breaks out into the higheſt impatience againſt God; and where hath it its chiefeſt vent? Why in perſecuting the Prophet <hi>Eliſha: God do ſo to me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and more alſo, if the Head of Eliſha the ſon of Shaphat, ſhall ſtand on him this day; and he ſenta man from before him to be the Executioner,</hi> whom <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> calls <hi>the ſon of a murtherer, ver.</hi> 31, 32. Now alas, what an abſurd and impertinent revenge was this? For ſuppoſe <hi>Eliſha</hi> had prayed for this puniſhment of Famine upon the wicked <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> what reaſon had this fooliſh falſly-religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64817:131"/>Wretch to think that there was any ſault in <hi>Eliſha?</hi> Could he bind up the clouds from rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Or would the Lord have anſwered a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which had been guilty of cruelty and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity? It was God who had ſent the Famine, not <hi>Eliſha;</hi> yea this wicked Prince acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much, <hi>This evil is of the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, ver. 33. but here is the my ſterie of this iniquity, he could not revenge himſelf upon Heaven; and therefore he lets out his rage upon the beſt man that was upon earth.</p>
            <p>All legal Worſhippers have at the bottom of their heart a deep hatred againſt God and his people.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, there is in the heart of every Legalliſt a ſpirit of envy and emulation. They are all ſenſible more or leſs, at one time or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they are not acceptable to God, and that theſe Puritans, theſe holy men are; and therefore they cannot endure them, they envy them for their greateſt excellencies, and for that they are the favourites of heaven; and they cannot endure, that ſeeing they take ſo much pains as they do in their wrong way (as indeed many of them are at great coſt and pains in their way) they cannot endure that any ſhould be preferred before them. Legalliſts and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Worſhippers are (as I may ſay) Rivals for the favour of God. Now the ſpiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers take the right way, the Legalliſts take the wrong way to obtain it; therefore the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e received, the latter are rejected and caſt out: What ſaith the Scriptures? <hi>Caſt out the bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her ſon</hi>—Now there can be no greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ud than that which is between Rivals. This
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64817:132"/>was the very caſe bet wixt <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> which I have ſeveral times explained. And <hi>Cain</hi> (as I have ſaid) had no other quarrel againſt <hi>Abel,</hi> but for that God accepted of his offering.</p>
            <p>But now whereas a legal ſpirit is thus wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, revengeful, envious; and murtherous, the Spirit of the Goſpel, and of all Saints, ſo far as they are baptized into a Goſpel-ſpirit, is a mica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>peaceable, meek, gentle, and eaſie to be entreated,</hi> James 3.17. <hi>Hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, envyings, murthers, are all fruits of the fleſh, and</hi> of thoſe that are <hi>BORN AFTER THE FLESH; but the fruit of the ſpirit is love, joy, peace, LONG-SUFFERING, GENTLENESS, GOODNESS;</hi> What excellent virtues are theſe for humane Society! The Legalliſt he cryes, <hi>It is not fit to ſuffer</hi> ſuch Wretches <hi>to live; away with ſuch an</hi> Heretick <hi>from the earth.</hi> Now for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ſpirited man, he could wiſh indeed St. <hi>Pauls</hi> wiſh in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.29. <hi>I would to God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that not onely thou, but all that hear me this day, were not onely almoſt, but altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe Bonds;</hi> he doth not wiſh them his Bonds, that was his GOODNESS, that laſt Goſpel-virtue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but he wiſheth that all his perſecutors were of his perſwaſion; ſo doth every good man; elſe he could not be a friend to the truth that he profeſſeth: But how to make them ſuch, he pretends to no other means but <hi>earneſt prayers, ſtrong arguments, and meek perſwaſions.

            <p>The application is onely this: So far as any are of a perſecuting ſpirit, ſo far they are Legal; and I fear there are great mixtures of this in the hearts of many good men; but I dare make this gueſs concerning them, that when they have well ſmarted (themſelves) by impoſitions and perſecutions for their conſciences, they will be heartily glad of a <hi>TOLERATION,</hi> which yet they would not have allowed to others, if they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64817:133"/>had had the power in their own hand; and I fear they will feel the ſmart as much as any ſort of men, (and perhaps more) for <hi>all that are good ſhall be ſure to feel the ſting of the Serpent;</hi> and thoſe moſt eſpecially that ſtand next him, hoping to make ſome accommodation, but yet are true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to him.

               <hi>viz.</hi> a ſpirit of Perſecution, and it is this; That <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Hagar's</hi> ſon, had his hand againſt every man: Upon which he quotes a deſcant of <hi>Philo.</hi> that it might ſignifie thus much, That the Legalliſt is a <hi>great and fierce Diſputer upon the Letter, a notable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical Divine; and his ignorance and untamedneſs of his carnal heart, makes him very hold and troubleſome.</hi> I ſhall need tranſcribe no more; but if the proof of theſe Propoſitions, that the Legalliſt is for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I proceed now to ſpeak to the laſt character,
<note place="margin">The laſt Character.</note> which is this: A man is ſo far Legal, as he is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly ignorant of Chriſt, or acts to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt in the daies of the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. when the Apoſtle had there rekoned up his external fleſhly privileges (which if he would have had a truſt and confidence in the fleſh, he might have boaſted of with any Phariſee of them all) theſe (ſaith he) were once <hi>gain</hi> to me; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them my riches, and my treaſure; but now, <hi>What things were gain to me, theſe I counted loſs for Chriſt: yea doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord: for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, NOT HAVING MY OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH IS OF THE LAW,</hi> but <hi>THAT WHICH IS THROUGH THE FAITH OF CHRIST, the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith. That I may know him, &amp;c.</hi> This which I have produced is evidently to the purpoſe: for that the Apoſtle is oppoſing the two righteouſneſſes, of the Law and Faith; and the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith is all one with the righteouſneſs which is through the Faith of Chriſt; and therefore that which he preſſeth forward unto, is to be found in him, and to know him in the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64817:135"/>conformable unto him in his death, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>But here I will mark (before I go any further) that there is an inſeparable connexion betwixt the righteouſneſs of Faith,
<note place="margin">There is an inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith, and true holineſs.</note> and the righteouſneſs of Sanctification; nay, they ſeem in this place to be put one for the other; for when the Apoſtle inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets his own expreſſions <hi>of counting all things loſſe and dung that he may win Chriſt, and that he may be ſound in him not having his own righteouſneſs, which is of the Law;</hi> he ſpeaks it in words that ſignifie ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification immediately and properly; <hi>But which is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is of God by Faith:</hi> What is that? it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; <hi>that I may know him, and the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable unto his death:</hi> Theſe are expreſſions of ſanctification; ſo it follows, ver. 11. <hi>If by any means I might obtain to the reſurrection of the dead:</hi> Which is the higheſt expreſſion of Sanctification in the whole Scripture, or at leaſt one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and ſo to the ſame purpoſe it follows ver. 12, 13, 14, 15.
<note n="*" place="margin">Vnleſs, we wil ſay that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the 7, 8 9. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and then, without any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on to ſpeak of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the following verſes.</note> Not but that there muſt ſtill be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per difference held betwixt Juſtification and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, for they have proper, different noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conceptions: Juſtification is an act of God without us; Sanctification is an act of the Spirit within us: Sanctification denominates the Perſon good; Juſtification denominates the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon accepted and well-pleaſing to God. But for any contradiction that there ſhould be in this, to ſay that the ſame inward holineſs which is called our Sanctification, may be the very condition of our Juſtification, I profeſs I know of none; not that I affirm that it is ſo, for indeed I am ſomwhat
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64817:135"/>ſhye of affirming in thoſe very words, though I ſhall afterwards have occaſion to ſay ſomething to the like purpoſe; but if I ſhould, I were not alone in the opinion, thoſe two Authors above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named would abundantly ſupply me with teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; for they frequently and ſtrenuouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, That the great <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I ſhall give now the ſame obſervation out of Dr. <hi>More,</hi> and ſo proceed. <hi>Pag.</hi> 387. of his <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Godlineſs,</hi>
               <q>It is plain (ſaith he) from the conſtant ſcope of the Apoſtle both in his Epiſtle <hi>to the Gal.</hi> and every where elſe in extolling the righteouſneſs of Faith, that he does not vilifie true virtue and morality, but drives at an higher pitch and perfection thereof, and that the righteouſneſs of Faith which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the righteouſneſs of works <hi>IS NOT BY WAY OF EXCLUSION OF GOOD WORKS OUT OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH,</hi> but of urging us to exacter and more perfect works of righteouſneſs than could be performed under the diſpenſation of the Law. And in <hi>pag.</hi> 379, where the Doctor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to explain the great term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he tells us, That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies any virtue or goodneſs in a man whatſoever, and that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is nothing elſe but to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as a good man; or, A doer of what is righteous and good, and that <hi>BECAUSE</hi> he doth that which is good and righteous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having made this great obſervation, of which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64817:136"/>I ſhall make more uſe anon. I ſhall proceed with my Character; <hi>That an affected ignorance of Chriſt, is an infallible Character of a Legal Spirit.</hi> I have given a Scripture for it, <hi>viz. Phil.</hi> 3.7.8. to the 15. upon which I have ſo long inſiſted; I ſhall give now the reaſon of it, which is this: For that all pardon of ſins (which is the greateſt thing in Goſpel-juſtification) was ever by virtue of the death of Chriſt. All the ſymbolical and vailed-Goſpel of the old Teſtament pointed (though darkly) unto Chriſt: The rock in the Wilderneſs was Chriſt, the Serpent was Chriſt, the Manna was Chriſt, the Scape-Goat was Chriſt, the Paſchal Lamb was Chriſt; and in the fulneſs of time <hi>Grace and the Truth</hi> (of theſe types) <hi>came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore thoſe that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly ignorant of Chriſt, are affectedly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of all that looked like Goſpel, and ſo of Goſpel-Grace it ſelf; &amp; nothing can be a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er argument of Legality then this. And indeed we may almoſt adventure to ſay, <hi>That moſt men ſo far as they are ignorant of Chriſt in theſe days of the Goſpel, they are affectedly ignorant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deferred this Character till the laſt, becauſe I would firſt put all thoſe Characters together, in which the faith of all the Old-Teſtament-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and ours did agree. All the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Saints were more for ſpiritual heart-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, than for the externals of Religion; they were all in their degree humble and patient; they were all in their degree quick, lively and vigorous; they had all a ſpirit of adoption in their meaſure; they were all of a ſweet, meek, and kind heart and ſpirit, not of a perſecuting principle; but I cannot ſay they all knew Chriſt

            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew briefly the peculiar addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of a Goſpel-faith, or rather a New-Teſtament Faith, without which, ours cannot be Evangelical enough, and ſo not juſtifying and ſaving: And without performing this part of my Work, I ſhould be guilty of a great abſurdity for taking up ſo many pages in deſcribing the Faith of the Old-Teſtament Saints, or of juſtifying-faith, which was common to us and them, and in the mean time to paſs by that which is proper to our ſelves, and as neceſſary as any thing which hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to.</p>
            <p>I affirm therefore, that we are to know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, as the <hi>PROCURING CAUSE</hi> of all our mercies, and the <hi>DISPENSER</hi> of all good things to us; Theſe are the two great things which we are to know and believe concerning Chriſt; to which we muſt add the meditation &amp; imitation of our Saviour, as a pattern in his Life, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion; in all which our Faith hath a great uſefulneſs and neceſſity; and unleſs our Faith hath a great and very conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto Chriſt in all theſe three particulars, we cannot juſtly put on the name of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>That old Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the Saints of the Old-Teſtament, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputes for, and proves they were juſtified by it, hath now a further Name, and is called the Chriſtian Faith, having taken up that great Object Chriſt, more
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64817:138"/>explicitely and plainly then ever they received it. I ſhall ſay ſomewhat, (but as briefly as I may) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the three generals, wherein our Faith is now neceſſarily to eye Jeſus Chriſt, that it may be of a right Goſpel ſtrain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">We muſt believe in Chriſt as the great procuring cauſe of all our mercies. 1. By his blood and offering.</note> Therefore a right New-Teſtament Faith eyes Chriſt as the procuring-cauſe of all our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and this in two reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> by his offering up himſelf a ſacrifice, and by his interceſſions. 1. By his dying for us, and offering up himſelf, he hath bought us, <hi>Ye are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6 20. <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us unto God by thy blood,</hi> Rev. 5.9. His blood was the price of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by ſhedding of this, and offering it up to God, he became a propitiation for our ſins, and we our ſelves are the purchaſe of this Price. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.—<hi>The Church of God which he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his own blood. We are purchaſed and redeemed from the world,</hi> Gal. 1.4. <hi>From our vain Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. Yea, Heaven it ſelf is purchaſed by his blood for us; for I doubt not but that is it which is called the <hi>purchaſed poſſeſſion,</hi> Eph. 1.14. Now ſee if we have not reaſon, nay if there be not abſolute neceſſity (if we would be right Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) to know Chriſt, and believe in him, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing-cauſe of all our Mercies, and that by his Death, and Blood, and offering himſelf; <hi>He hath by one offering perfected for ever them that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Heb. 10.14.</p>
            <p>Now our Faith as it eyes thus the death of Chriſt, is called <hi>faith in his blood;</hi> and Juſtification follows upon this Faith onely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace, THROUGH THE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEMPTION THAT IS IN CHRIST, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation THROUGH

               </gap> to pardon ſins) by which he became propitious and appeaſed, and for it receives all true penitents into his favour; that is, for the judgement or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of faith to the dogmatical truth in this matter, then for its affiance, faith in the blood of Chriſt, it is a not doubting but whilſt I have the Goſpel-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juſtification (what ever it be) this blood will procure my pardon; or thus, in the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to reſt upon God for pardon, for the ſake of Chriſt's blood-ſhedding, and offering it to God. Now this faith in the blood of Chriſt I look upon as an eſſential branch of a New-Teſtament-faith.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2ly His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion.</note> Secondly we are to look upon Chriſt as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe of all our mercies by his interceſſions, whereby he reaps the benefit of the purchaſe of his blood. His Blood was the foundation of all his Interceſſion, and his Interceſſion is as the harveſt to that ſeed-time, when he ſowed in tears of blood. <hi>He entred into the holy of holies by his own blood;</hi> if he had not had that blood with him, I conceive
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64817:140"/>there had been no entrance for him there as a Prieſt; but now that he is there entred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained <hi>as an High-prieſt for ever, and ever liveth to make interceſſion for us,</hi> Heb. 7.25. We are to look upon him as the great procuring-cauſe of all our mercies by his interceſſions: <hi>If when we were enemies, we were reconciled unto God by the DEATH of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his LIFE,</hi> Rom 5.10. 1 John 2.1. <hi>My lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not; and if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> (<hi>HE IS</hi> to this very day, upon occaſion of any failing of the Saints, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſeth to make God propitious to them, and not onely to them, ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>not onely for our ſins, who are the Saints of God, but for the ſins of the whole world:</hi> He doth now, as he did at his death, and firſt entring into Heaven, (though not in the ſame form of offering, which was but <hi>ONCE</hi>) make uſe of his blood with his Father, to prevail with him, that he may be ready to pardon, and receive into favour all that come unto God by him; <hi>all that are come in</hi> upon any of their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and <hi>all that ſhall come</hi> in with unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for their wicked lives paſt.</p>
            <p>And as I ſhewed in the former particular of his death and blood, that he did not onely procure pardon of ſin by it, but redeemed us from our vain converſation, and purchaſed heaven it ſelf for us; ſo in this particular I might ſhew, that he doth not onely procure pardon of ſins for us by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, as our Advocate, but every thing elſe that we ſtand in need of: <hi>I am going to my Father,</hi> ſaith our Saviour when he was leaving the World)
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64817:141"/>and there I will povide <hi>Manſions for you; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye ask the Fther in my Name, I will do it,</hi> Joh. 14.2, 3, 13. Thus therefore our Faith, if we would have it a right New-Teſtament Faith, muſt eye Chriſt in his interceſſion; and whatever we deſire of God, we muſt ask it in his Name, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt as an Advocate with the Father, wil take the care of it. So much for the firſt Head, or general Rule of a New-Teſtament-Faith: We are to eye Chriſt as the great procuring cauſe of all our mercies.</p>

                  </gap>ſpenſer of all good things to us.</note> We are to look upon Chriſt as the great Diſpenſer of all our good things to us. Our Saviour Chriſt hath the diſtribution &amp; diſpoſal of all things committed to him, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> had in <hi>Aegypt: The Father judgeth no man, but all judgement is committed by the Father to the Son,</hi> John 5.22.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64817:141"/>raiſed up Jeſus whom ye ſlew and hanged on a Tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and ſorgiveneſs of ſins; and we are his witneſſes of theſe things, and ſo is the Holy Ghoſt whom God hath given to them that obey him.</hi> In a word, Chriſt hath all power both in heaven and in earth: So our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our came and told his Diſciples after he was riſen, Matth. 28.18, 19. <hi>Jeſus came, and spake unto them</hi> (the eleven) <hi>ſaying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: Go ye THEREFORE, and teach all Nations.</hi> This is the form of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which makes an Apoſtle (I have received po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, therefore go teach) they are not the Apoſtles of God immediately, but <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt, by the will of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.1. 2 Cor. 1.1. Eph. 1.1.</p>
            <p>To inſtance in the ſeveral branches of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in heaven and earth, would be too much for me in this place; there is the power of pardoning ſins, raiſing the dead, judging the world, deſtroying the wicked: Theſe, with many other, I could prove by plain Scripture to be all depoſited and be-truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hand of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now what is the Faith that belongs to Chriſt as the Diſpenſer of all good things to us? (for that is my proper buſineſs to enquire after) Why, even the Faith that we place in God the Father: This Chriſt taught his Diſciples when he was about to leave them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe alſo in me:</hi> As much as to ſay, Ye have been uſed hitherto (by your Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-Faith) to believe in God, and you have found comfort and ſupport in it, and yet you do not ſee that God you believe in: Why ſo now for my ſelf, I am going in deed out of your ſight, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64817:142"/>at this you are troubled, but believe in me when I am out of your ſight, as ye have hitherto beheved in an inviſible God, and ye ſhall find the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport in this Faith, as ever ye found from Faith in God.</p>
            <p>None ſo common a New-Teſtament phraſe, as believing in Chriſt; <hi>He that believeth in me, though he weee dead, yet ſhall he live; and whoſoever liveth and believeth in me, ſhall never dye;</hi> Joh. 11.25.26. and our Saviour there giveth a very ſatisfactory reaſon,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt faith in Chriſt, and in God the Father</note> which is this, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life;</hi> therefore he that believeth on the Son, hath life, and ſhall have a reſurrection unto liſe. Our Faith ought to be the ſame in the perſon of Chriſt, as it is in God the Father, onely with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>it muſt not be terminated in Chriſt as the ultimate object of our Faith,</hi> but only as he is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and great Diſpenſer of all things to us by a Power derived from the Father; For this take that eminent place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Who <hi>BY HIM</hi> (that is Chriſt) <hi>DO BELIEVE IN GOD, that raiſed him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</hi> This I do but touch upon here; it would require a large Treatiſe to ſpeak unto it as the ſubject deſerves, <hi>viz:</hi> how we are to direct our Faith and applications to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in a different manner then to God the Father; but this is that which I am upon, That in the general we are to ſix our Faith upon Chriſt as the great Diſpenſer of all good things unto us, if we would have it of a right Goſpel-ſtrain, nay if we expect to be juſtified by our faith; for if God ſet up a Mediator, a Diſpenſer of all his bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, (as <hi>Pharoah</hi> (pardon the alluſion) ſet up <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> and required that all men ſhould go to him
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64817:142"/>for what they wanted) will he (think you) take it well that you ſhould take no notice of his <hi>Joſeph,</hi> his dearly beloved, and onely begotten Son? But come to himſelf immediately; dare you do it! Can you ever hope for acceptation in this way of addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your ſelves to God? Might you not juſtly fear that God will prove a conſuming fire to you in in ſuch approaches? So much for the ſecond; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral head, in which our Faith is to reſpect Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But 3dly, there is ſomething more requiſite yet to be done by our Faith, with reſpect to Chriſt, than meerly to look upon him as the procuring-cauſe, and the diſpenſing-cauſe of all our mercies, if we would have it a right New-Teſtament-faith, or a Juſtifying-Faith in the dayes of the Goſpel, our Faith muſt conform us unto Chriſt as a pattern and example: Now there is a two-fold conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto Chriſt which our Faith effects, one Proper, the other Analogical; that which is proper, is to put us upon doing as he did, to be as he was, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meek, lowly, <hi>&amp;c. Learn of me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) theſe things, and ye ſhall <hi>receive reſt unto your ſouls,</hi> Matth. 11.29. Phil. 25.6. <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you which was in Chriſt Jeſus, who made himſelf of no reputation, &amp;c. Looking unto Jeſus, who</hi>—Heb. 12.2. But then there is an Analogical conformity which Faith effects, and that is an anſwerableneſs to ſome things in Chriſt, which it is not our duty to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in a proper ſenſe, as now to be conformable unto Chriſt in his death, burial, and reſurrection; theſe we cannot in a proper ſenſe be conformable unto him in, except we be hanged upon a croſs till we are dead; then laid in our graves, then raiſed by the power of God, &amp;c.

               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:64817:144"/>our duty to go about to imitate properly, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome reſemblance and likeneſs. Our Faith muſt bring us to the croſs of Chriſt, and teach us the cruciſixion and mortification of our old man, with the affections and luſts of it; it muſt bring us to the grave of Chriſt, and we muſt be there bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1.4. <hi>We are buried with him by baptiſm into death;</hi> and by this death and burial we muſt reckon our ſelves to <hi>be dead unto ſin,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>He that is dead, is ſreed from ſin,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein,</hi> ver. 2. Yea our Faith muſt earry us yet further beyond death and the grave, into heaven it ſelf; we muſt riſe with him into newneſs of life; <hi>For if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>And as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>And we muſt ſit together with him in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places,</hi> in our affections at leaſt. <hi>If ye be riſer with Chriſt, ſeek theſe things that are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God. Set your aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on things above, not on things on the earth, for you are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.1, 2, 3. Faith in the dayes of the Goſpel carries us to the example and pattern of Chriſt, &amp; conforms us to it, both in a proper and Analogical confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; ſo that we have ſomething in us that bears ſome Analogy and likeneſs to every thing that is to be found in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this third reſpect, wherein our ſaith eies Jeſus Chriſt, looks more like obedience then faith, more like ſanctification, than that by which moſt expect juſtification: and ſeeing this is not the proper place to ſhew how far obedience, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64817:144"/>holineſs, and good works have an influence upon Juſtification, I ſhall not inſiſt more upon this; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting my ſelf with the two other reſpects in which faith eies Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> As the procurer and diſpencer of all good things unto us, which none can with any fair pretence deny to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to our faith as juſtifying, in the days of the New-Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now to quicken, and ſo to end this Character, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſo far as we leave out Chriſt, we are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in the buſineſs of Juſtication; I ſhall repreſent the Reader with the example of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (which I have glanced at already) who was once highly legal, end afterwards as eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evangelical, and that in the daies of the Goſpel. And I ſhould think <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf was not a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſon to give an account of the vanity of worldly comforts, than St. <hi>Paul</hi> was to acquaint us with that vanity &amp; vexation of ſpirit that there is in pretended legal righteouſneſs, as alſo with that perfect ſatisfaction which the Evangelical righteouſneſs brings into the ſoul: and 'tis from him indeed, and from his Epiſtles (no doubt indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit of God) that this whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſe hath been raiſed. He was as to his deſcent, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Hebrew, born of Hebrew parents both father and mother, and of a ſpecial and beloved tribe, and circumciſed the eighth day exactly according to the Law: for his profeſſion, of the ſtricteſt ſect <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Law a Phaiſee: for his zeal in his profeſſion it was exceeding great, <hi>I proſited</hi> (ſaies he, Gal. 1.14.) <hi>in the Jew's Religion above many my equals in mine own nation; being more exceeding zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the traditions of my fathers.</hi> And there was
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64817:145"/>no greater argument of his being an high Legal liſt than this, That he was a bitter perſecutor of the way of the Goſpel, as he tells us in three ſeveral Epiſtles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Beyond meaſure I perſecuted the Church of God, and waſted it.</hi> Phil. 3.6. <hi>concerning Zeal perſecuting the Church.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. You have his catalogue of privileges altogether, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, and there he makes a challenge to any Jew, any Phariſee of them all to ſhew the ſame grounds and reaſons of fleſhly conſidence and boaſting that he could ſhew for himſelf; <hi>If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might boaſt in the fleſh, I MORE.</hi> Now if there had been any goodneſs in that way of a Phariſaical righteouſueſs, which S <hi>Paul</hi> with his utmoſt zeal purſued after, cectainly he muſt have fonnd it. But as ſoon as ever the <hi>Lord was pleaſed to call him by his grace, and to REVEAL HIS SON IN HIM,</hi> Gal. 1.15, 16, he caſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all his riches and treaſures of a legal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as droſs, dung, and dog's-meat, not fit for children to feed upon: and what is it that he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth? what is it that can thus metamorphoſe and tranſpoſe him? what doth he ſee? what hath he eſpied in the Goſpel? Why, it is Chriſt; a ſingle Chriſt: He ſells all that he had to buy this Pearle, and thinks himſelf made for ever if he can but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs ſuch a purchaſe. <hi>Yea doubtleſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I count all theſe but dung that</hi> I <hi>may</hi> WIN Chriſt, or gain Chriſt; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>and be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p>So we have ſeen the metamorphoſis, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of this man, his leaving all his Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Legal Righteouſneſs for a ſingle Chriſt, we
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64817:145"/>will ſee a little further what uſe he makes of Chriſt now that he hath choſen him, and thus centred his ſoul upon him. Why, he will needs know more of him; <hi>I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord,</hi> Phil. 3.8. and ſaies he, <hi>I count them but dung that I may win Chriſt, and that I may know him,</hi> ver. 8.10. There are indeed <hi>all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge hid in him,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well might he preſs after the knowledge of him. Again he will love him: <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be accurſed,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. He will believe in him: <hi>I would be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through</hi> THE FAITH OF CHRIST. Laſtly, he will make his glorying and boaſt of him, and that is the higheſt honour we can do to God: for men glory in that which they account their excellency; yea, St. <hi>Paul</hi> chooſeth out that in Chriſt to glory in, which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eyes of the world, and that is the croſs of Chriſt; which ſhews what an high eſteem he had of him: <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I ſhould glory in any thing ſave in the croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.14 And though the blind world could ſee nothing in this Croſs that they ſhould rejoice or glory in, yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw theſe great things in the Croſs of Chriſt, that upon it he vanquiſhed Principalities and Powers, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. that he removed all that from off us, that was contrary to us, nailing it to his croſs; ſo that he might well ſay as he doth, <hi>Gal:</hi> 2.19. <hi>I through the Law am dead to the Law, that I might live to God;</hi> that is, through what the Law hath done to my Saviour, it hath nothing to do with me, I am dead to it, and that is dead to me.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64817:146"/>Again, ſee another great efficacy that St. <hi>Paul</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyed in the Croſs of Chriſt, and that was, that it helped him to conquer the World; <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt, by which the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world:</hi> No wouder therefore if he chuſeth the croſs of Chriſt to glory in. Once more we find him in another Scripture chuſing his infirmities to glory in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>I take pleaſure in inſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecution, in diſtreſſes for Chriſt's ſake:</hi> And what is the reaſon, why not onely for that theſe are a part of Chriſt's Croſs, but becauſe when theſe things did preſs him down, then did the arm of Chriſt ſupport him, and the Power of Chriſt reſt upon him. <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the POWER OF CHRIST MAY REST UPON ME; for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong;</hi> that is, with the ſtrength which is in Chriſt Jeſus; and therefore hedoth not only deſire that he himſelf might thus know, love, believe, and glory in Jeſus Chriſt, but he begs for others, that they might have <hi>a Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1.16, 17. It were almoſt an infinite Work to trace St: <hi>Paul</hi> in all the ways of his treating Chriſt, and uſing of him; take therefore one place for all, Gal. 2.20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I live;</hi> that is one Riddle. <hi>I live, yet not I;</hi> there is another Riddle: But whence ariſe theſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? Why from his converſing with, and poſſeſſing of Chriſt. <hi>I live; but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>'tis not I any longer; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh,</hi> (the whole of my life) <hi>it is by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> (that is, Faith in the Son of God) <hi>who loved me, and gave himſelf for me:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64817:146"/>Paul</hi> is dead, he lives no longer; but Chriſt lives in <hi>Paul</hi> (if you will) and then no wonder St. <hi>Paul</hi> can do all things, as he tells us he can, when ſuch a perſon lives in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound, every where, and in all things, I am inſtructed both to be full, and to the hungry; both to abound, and to ſuffer need;</hi> I <hi>can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthens me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the whole of a Chriſtians liſe when he is like himſelf, is a life of Faith upon Chriſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; his Fleſh and Blood is his food; his Grace and Spirit is his ſtrength; the living of Chriſt in him (which is a Myſtical expreſſion) is his life; <hi>For you are dead, and YOUR LIFE IS HID WITH CHRIST in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. That Chriſtian there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is not intimately acquainted with Chriſt, is ſo far legal: The truth of this aſſertion is clear from this example, for that as ſoon as ever St. <hi>Paul</hi> had Chriſt revealed in him, he left all his legal righteouſneſs, and faſtned upon Chriſt altogether in this manner, which we have partly declared.</p>
            <p>And indeed, this is the Character of Characters; all the other Characters before given, ſignifie but little without this: It is by means of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we call God Father, that we are freed from that ſlaviſh fear of God, which even the Saints of the Old-Teſtament were under in a great meaſure; the Heir before was kept in fear; <hi>but when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons; and becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the SPIRIT of his SON into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father,</hi> Gal. 4 3, 4, 5, 6. It is by Chriſt's coming that we are freed from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64817:147"/>fleſhly way of ſerving God in a worldly Sanctuary, and by carnal Ordinances: It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible, whilſt it was the duty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God to worſhip God with ſo much ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſervice, but they ſhould dote too much upon thoſe externals of worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>

            <p>The truth is, the great thing that we have to mind as Chriſtians, is the knowledge of Chriſt; the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> And I have often thought, that they who would ſtudy the Goſpel aright, ſhould endeavour to find out what there is peculiar in the Goſpel, above whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was before revealed; for they ſhall find that in the Goſpel there is the <hi>hidden wiſdom</hi> of God revealed, ſuch myſteries of wiſdom as were <hi>before hidden from ages and generations,</hi> and I believe there is no greater prejudice to the advance of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Theology, or the knowledge of God, than that it is ſo generally preſumed, yea and aſſerted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that there is nothing in a manner new in the Go, ſpel, neither precepts nor promiſes; but that the Faith of the Saints in all ages was the ſame that it is now, onely they appreheuded the ſame things ſomewhat more obſcurely then we do, and ſo for the Precepts, that they were always the ſame Now this preſumption will unavoidably hinder all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry, and the New-Teſtament ſhall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no more to us then the old will do; and ſo we
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64817:147"/>ſhall neceſſarily put our ſelves again under the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, inſtead of the Evangelical Adminiſtration, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God in the <hi>OLDNESS OF THE LETTER,</hi> which is the Law; and not in the <hi>NEWNESS OF THE SPIRIT,</hi> which is the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. Whereas to any diligent and unprejudiced enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer it will appear, that there are a thouſand new things in the Goſpel, and all of them referring more or leſs to Chriſt. I ſhall give but two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for this, and ſo come to the application of the character: The firſt is this, in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>I am made a Miniſter</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to fulfil the Word of God, even the Myſtery which hath been hid FROM AGES AND GENEEATIONS, but NOW IS MADE MANIFEST TO HIS SAINTS, to whom God would make known the riches of this Myſtery amongſt the Gentiles, which is, CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of Glory.</hi> Chriſt is all the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; all the myſterious things of the Goſpel are to be more or leſs referred to Chriſt. The ſecond Scripture is <hi>Eph</hi> 3. of which I might tranſcribe more then half the chapter; ſee ver. <hi>9. To make all men ſee what is the fellowſhip of the Myſterie which from the beginning of the world hath been HID IN GOD,
<note place="margin">See Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorat in loc.</note> who CREATED ALL THINGS BY JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST:</hi> This (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) <hi>Non tam de prima creatione interpretari libet, quam de inſtauratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſpirituali; circumſtantia enim loci poſtulat ut de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novatione intelligamus, quae continetur in beneficio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptionis:</hi> That is, This creation of all things by Jeſus Chriſt, is not ſo much to be underſtood of the firſt creation of the world, as of the inſtauration and renovation, or new Goſpel-ſtate of things, into which God hath put them by Jeſus Chriſt. So the next verſe unavoidably carries the ſenſe, ver.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64817:148"/>10, 11. <hi>To the intent that NOW unto the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers in heavenly places, MIGHT BE MADE KNOWN by the Church the manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, according to the eternal purpoſe which he PURPOSED IN CHRIST JESUS our Lord</hi> What, did not the Angels know the Myſteries of the firſt creation till the dayes of the Goſpel? O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are they inſtructed by the Church in the Myſteries of the firſt Creation? Are Chriſtians (as ſuch) ſo great natural Philoſophers, as that Angels may come and learn of them? The ſenſe therefore is plainly thus; That in the <hi>dayes of the Goſpel there is a quite new Model, and new conſtitution of things, by vertue of the Mediatorial Kingdom which Jeſus Chriſt hath received of his Father;</hi> and much of this the Angels learn from the Church: Who therefore, but a rank Legalliſt, will ſtudy Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I come now to the application of the Character.
<note place="margin">The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Character firſt to the diſcovery of partial Legality.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And here I ſhall ſomewhat alter my method which I uſed in the application of the other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; for here I ſhall begin with the diſcovery of partial Legality, which may be found in the Saints from this Character, and afterwards come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Legality from it. Firſt of all then, Is our New-Teſtament-Faith to act ſo much upon Jeſus Chriſt, yea upon him immediately for all things, for pardon, for ſtrength of Grace, for temporal deliverances, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Then theſe Saints are much too blame, and greatly guilty of Legality, that go to God without Chriſt in any meaſure: If men go to God in the daves of the Goſpel, and where the Goſpel hath been preached <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for I have to do with none other at this time) I ſay, if ſuch men go to God without Chriſt altogether, they are not Saints at all, cannot be Saints, (of theſe I ſhall ſpeak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>non.) But there are a generation of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64817:148"/>Saints, and perhaps the greateſt number, who do truly believe in Chriſt, that yet go to God without Chriſt in a great meaſure; they are Chriſtians Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally, but yet they are not well verſed, nor practiſed enough in treating with Chriſt, and with God through Chriſt: but make their immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to God almoſt in every prayer, in every act of Faith; they cannot ſpeak in a Goſpel Dialect; but are as if they were ſtill living in the daies of the Old Teſtament, where, that a man feared and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in God, was his great character of Saintſhip. Nay, I would adventure to make this cenſure of hundreds of Chriſtians, that are good and holy men; that, were it not for the doctrine of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Juſtice of God which hath an hold upon them, they do not diſcover wherein they have any need or uſe of Jeſus Chriſt at all either as King, or Prophet of his people, though indeed they wil conſent unto all theſe things when they are preached; &amp; therefore in charity muſt be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have that reſpect unto Chriſt w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, even in theſe particulars alſo; &amp; I think many Miniſters are greatly to blame (who are otherwiſe good men) in that they preach no more of Chriſt unto their people: That this is Legality where it is found, I think there is no need of further proof, this character ſufficiently convinceth of it; yet I ſhall in ſearching out this diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> Ignorance, and neglect of Chriſt, both in Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, prove it to be a ſymptome of Legality from another character mentioned.</p>
            <p>And truly I cannot gueſs what ſhould be the reaſon of this ignorance and neglect of Chriſt ſo general and common, even amongſt thoſe that are good, but from a liſtleſneſs and irkſomneſs to, and wearineſs of the waies and knowledge of God. Good people may (chance) think that they know
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64817:149"/>a great deal of God already, they know enough for their converſe between man and man, and for many duties of worſhip to God, and they find this as much as they can attend, together with their buſineſſes and imployments in the world, and ſo much they know of Chriſt that he died for their ſins, and intercedes with his Father for them, and this is enough to ſatisfie them; what ſhould they trouble themſelves any more about any Goſpel Myſteries concerning Jeſus Chriſt, as his Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Kingdom and the like, how God the Father orders and diſpoſes of all things by him, how they are to make their applications to him. Now this liſtleſneſs &amp; careleſneſs, I made before a plain ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Legality; for the more Evangelical we are, the more chearful we are in the ſervice of God; the more attentive to, and inquiſitive about any thing that he makes known to us, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jeſus Chriſt; every duſt of this Pearl is precious.</p>
            <p>I come in the ſecond place to condemn predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Legality from this Character;
<note place="margin">Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from this Character 1. In the Jews.</note> and this wil convince two or three ſorts of men of predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Legality: And firſt of all, to be ſure this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the <hi>Jews</hi> of predominant Legality, both thoſe that were at the time of Chriſt's coming, and have been ever ſince unto this day, for that they denied then, and ſtill deny to receive Chriſt at all: If they had been Evangelical under the Old-Teſtament, they would gladly have received Chriſt, who is the ſubſtance and ſpirit of all that Goſpel which they had but darkly diſcovered in their diſpenſation. They that love the dawnings of the day-light, how much more would they be in love with the Sun of Righteouſneſs? but becauſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64817:149"/>their hearts were ſet upon the Law before Chriſt came, therefore were they ſuch enemies to Chriſt when he was come; and there is no clearer proof of the charge which the Apoſtle oftentimes draws up againſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were legal, than this, that they are the great enemies of the croſs of Chriſt; and the ſame may be all applied to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Jews</hi> that are enemies to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, This diſcovers the Legality of the Modern Scribes and Phariſees, and Zelotical Ceremonial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts (as Dr. <hi>Moore</hi> calls them; thoſe that are ſo much for the externals of Religion in the days of the Goſpel; that would ſet up a ceremonial Law again of their own inventing; theſe argue their great affected ignorance of Chriſt, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, by which theſe ſhadows are certainly done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for that the Body is come; and this I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a very ſhrewd ſign (though perhaps not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely concluding) of predominant Legality. But of theſe I have ſpoken largely already, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not enlarge further about them, though they come here upon a new account to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and reproved.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, (and ſo I ſhal end my Characters as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun them, <hi>vide</hi> pag. 117. the ſecond obſervation premiſed to the Characters) All thoſe that have a zeal for God in the dayes of the Goſpel, and yet are not for a ſingle Chriſt, and for the purity and ſimplicity of the Goſpel, are legal; for that <hi>all Religion which is not the right Religion, is Legal.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> corrupted the Goſpel by adding the obſervations of the Law to it: The <hi>Greeks</hi> and Philoſophers deſtroyed the Goſpel by inventions of worſhipping Angels, and other voluntary humilities, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.18. <hi>Beware leſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vain deceit, after
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64817:150"/>the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and NOT AFTER CHRIST,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility, and worſhipping of Angels, intruding into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen, NOT HOLDING THE HEAD;</hi> both theſe forts the Apoſtle ſets himſelf vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt in ſeveral places of his Epiſtles. Now whoſoever ſhall in a likeneſs to either <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Philoſopher, go about to deſtroy the ſimplieity of the Goſpel, or the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, as it is called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. let him have never ſo much zeal in his way, is legal; and the reaſon is this, for that whoſoever goes about to eſtabliſh his own righteouſneſs, is legal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. Now all thoſe that deſtroy the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, &amp; yet have a zeal for God, go to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs. I have now done with the Characters</p>
            <p>Having diſcharged now after a ſort, theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral great parts of my Work; ſhewn firſt that the Law could not juſtifie, and that yet men wil needs ſeek Juſtification by the Law, and having given the deſcription of their Legality, what it is formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it ſelf, as alſo by the ſeveral characters of a Legal Spirit, wherein it diſcovers that diſtemper which is otherwiſe many times unſearchable; I hold my ſelf now to be a little at leiſure to ſpeak unto ſome things in general touching Juſtification, which I had no ſitter place to ſpeak unto, then this, and wil yet (I hope) further conduce unto the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and explaining of the great ſubject that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
            <p>There may be therefore theſe ſeveral queſtions ſpoken to about Juſtification: 1. At what time or times a perſon is uſtified, 2. For what act or acts a perſon is uſtified. Theſe two queſtions (the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64817:150"/>firſt of which contains ſeveral queſtions in it) I ſhall firſt diſpatch, and then ſpeak unto ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that wil ariſe to be ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>The firſt Queſtion is this;
<note place="margin">The firſt queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. <hi>At what time or times is a finner juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>At what time or times is a ſinner juſtified?</hi> This contains theſe two queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: 1. <hi>Whether or no a ſinner be juſtified from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether (if he be onely juſtified in time) Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, conſidered as God's act, be one or more, that is, be done once for all at his ſtrſt Juſtification, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated often upon the perſon juſtified, according to the exigency of the perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt Q. <hi>Whether Juſtification be from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or in time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to anſwer and reſolve this Queſtion, 1. I ſhould not have made this Queſtion at all, but for that ſome have aſſerted that we are juſtified from Eternity; and I have heard it openly affirmed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, that Juſtification is an immanent act in God, like the eternal generation of the Son. 2. Now for the actions or acts which we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in Eternity, they either reſpect God himſelf or the Creatures; Thoſe that reſpect himſelf, are ſuch as whereby he underſtood, loved, and enjoyed himſelfe; and what other ſoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or acts can be certainly aſcribed unto God, with relation to his own Eſſence, but with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his creatures, no other can be conceived, but in the way of purpoſing and decreeing what he would be pleaſed to do in time; 'tis very true, what that Scripture aſſirms, <hi>that known unto God are all his works from the beginning of he world, Acts</hi> 15.18. that is, which he intended to work: But that God ſhould be ſaid to do any action <hi>adextra,</hi> that is, without himſelf, ſuch as Juſtification is, which is terminated upon another perſon, without the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64817:151"/>compaſs of his own Eſſence, when yet there was nothing but himſelf in being, is to me a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. God might indeed in the eternal counſel of his own uncontroulable Wil &amp; Pleaſure, <hi>PURPOSE</hi> to juſcifie ſuch and ſuch perſons after he had made them; but what is this to actual Juſtification? It may be as wel ſaid (in my mind) that the World was created faom eternity, becauſe God purpoſed in his Eternal Counſels to create the World, as it can be ſaid that any were juſtified from eternity, becauſe God purpoſed from all eternity to juſtifie them. <hi>Purpoſe and Decree is one thing, Acting and Performance is another.</hi> 3. I cannot underſtand any countenance which this opinion hath from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; when the Scripture comes to ſpeak of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, it expreſſeth it ſelf as of an action done in time onely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>What ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs:</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>How was it thon reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned? WHEN he was in circumciſion, or in uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion? Not in circumciſion, but in uncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> that is, in the time of his uncircumciſion. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is not ſaid to have been juſtified from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but upon his actual believing; and this actual believing was in the time of his uncircumciſion. 4. Seeing juſtification follows onely upon Faith, (as the Scripture tells us) Juſtification cannot be before Faith: Now Faith is onely in time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Juſtification was not in Eternity, which was before all time. I ſhall trouble my ſelf with no more as to the anſwer of the firſt queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtification be in Eternity, or in Time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now follows the ſecond queſtion; <hi>If it be in time, at what time is it? And how often is it? Once onely, or oftner?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:64817:151"/>Here are two queſtions more in one, 1. <hi>At what time is it?</hi> Now for anſwer; Seeing that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith is the righteouſneſs which God alone accepts unto Juſtification, therefore Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation commenceth onely from the time of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: When was <hi>Abraham</hi> juſtified? Why when he believed; that therefore is the time of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its beginning.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion therefore now before us, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, <hi>Whether this one act of Juſtification, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently follows upon our act of believing, ſerves for the juſtification of our perſons as long as we live; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any repetition of God's act of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon our perſons afterwards?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for anſwer to this, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is indeed no contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Queſt. I ſay, 1. That indeed the firſt act of Juſtification (when Divine approbation comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, according to the Law and Statute of the New-Covenant, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. That by him all that believe are juſtified) putsi us into a ſtate of favour; and (if there be no interciſion in the ſtate, which the <hi>Arminians</hi> hold there may be) this firſt act is the great and famous act that makes us happy and bleſſed.</p>
            <p>But yet 2dly, I hold, that ſeeing Juſtification chiefly conſiſts in pardoning of ſins, (according to that Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe are JUSTIFIED FROM ALL THINGS FROM WHICH YE COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED by the Law of Moſes)</hi> every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed act of Pardon is a renewed act of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for though the firſt act of God's juſtifying us, upon our turning to God, do acquit us from all
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64817:152"/>our ſins till that moment; yet every new ſin brings a new guilt for which we might juſtly be condemned without a new act of juſtifying grace; and though every new ſin doth not put us out of the ſtate of juſtification, yet it requires a new act of juſtifying grace for the continuing the ſtate; and this makes the Advocateſhip of Chriſt neceſſary to be continued, who, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saint commits a ſin, he interpoſeth with his Father, that, upon his repentance, a pardon may be iſſued forth in the Court of heaven for that ſoul, as to that ſin: This I hold neceſſary even for every ſinfull infirmity of any Saint of God; that is, I hold Chriſt's interceſſion and our habitual repentance at leaſt and faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, chough many times there cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual repentance and faith for pardon, as in the caſe of ſecret and unobſerved ſins. But yet even in ſuch caſes our habitual and general repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is neceſſary, together with Chriſt's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and a renewed act of pardon unto our juſtification
<note n="*" place="margin">I would not be thought to make this <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> which conſiſts in continued pardon, to be of like conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the firſt act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douing &amp; juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace at firſt believing; I only contend for this, That it is true and neceſſary juſtification.</note> And in extraordinary caſes the truth of my aſſertion will be much more viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for when any Saint commits ſuch a great ſin as (according to the doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants) makes him no Saint for the time; here muſt certainly be repeated a new famous act of Juſtification (according to their doctrine as famous as the firſt was) as well as a new act of converſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:64817:152"/>But I need not go to this Suppoſition of a Saints falling away; for I can ſhew that this is no abſonous or unheard of thing in the Scripture, that Juſtification may be repeated even upon a Saint of God that keeps his ſtanding. See that Scripture in <hi>James</hi> 2.21. <hi>Was not Abraham our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtified by works, when he had offered up Iſaac his ſon upon the Altar?</hi> ver. 22. <hi>And the Scripture was</hi> (then) <hi>fulfilled, which ſaith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteouſneſs.</hi> Now when was this Juſtification of <hi>Abraham</hi> which is here mentioned? Why it was at leaſt thirteen years after <hi>Abrahams</hi> firſt famous Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; for that was upon his believing that God would give him a Son; this was upon his offering up the Son after he was given, when he was grown up to be a ſtout Lad, and could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the wood for his father up the hill. That firſt act of Juſtification paſſed upon him when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf <hi>was in uncircumoiſion;</hi> this after he and all his family were circumciſed: therefore the act of Juſtification may be repeated over ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times upon the ſame perſon.</p>
            <p>And for a little countenance for this from the authority of Authors, Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes makes mention of a threefold Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>inchoate, continued,</hi> and <hi>ſinall,</hi> Theſis 59. pag. 233.
<q>Juſtification is not a momentaneous act begun and ended immediately upon our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; but a continued act, which though it be in its kinde compleat from the firſt, yet is it ſtill in doing till the final Juſtification at the Judgment day. <hi>Pag.</hi> 303. <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified long before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was offered; yet Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification being a continued act, God is ſtill
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64817:153"/>juſtifying, and the Goſpel ſtill juſtifying, and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Juſtification was not ended before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was offered <hi>(nor then neither) and therefore was then in a proper ſenſe ſaid to be juſtified when he offered up Iſaac:</hi> theſe latter expreſſions which I add are full to Mr <hi>Baxter</hi>'s ſenſe in that place.</q> It is all one in my minde whether we uſe the word repeated or continued when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to Juſtification; for I think an act can be no otherwiſe continued but by repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The beſt <hi>ſim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le</hi> of an act continued is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Line, which they ſay is <hi>fluxus pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum,</hi> and yet points have no other continuity but by repetition.</p>
            <p>I know a learned man that anſwers this by diſtinguiſhing upon Juſtification, telling us that Juſtification may be taken either for Univerſal pardon of ſins, which is done at firſt believing; or elſe it is taken for divine approbation: the firſt (he ſaith) <hi>viz.</hi> General pardon, is done but once; but acts of approbation may be frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as here they were upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo he ſaid to be juſtified twice, though he kept his ſtanding in grace betwixt the two acts of his Juſtification. Now I do not deny that there are theſe two things in Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> Pardon and Approbation; but ſince pardon of particular ſins is often repeated as well as acts of Approbation, therefore methinks Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may well be ſaid to be repeated in both theſe parts of it, though I alwaies hold that the firſt act of Univerſal pardon is the moſt famous.

Now neither of theſe acts of faith are ſaid to be in the blood of Chriſt, and yet are ſaid by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be juſtifying acts.</p>
            <p>If it be objected that theſe acts of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith had reſpect to Chriſt who was the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed, as well as <hi>Iſaac;</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at trivial in the preſent caſe: for the Scriptures lay the ſtreſs of Gods appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or juſtifying <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon his faith in the power of God, at leaſt they do openly referr Juſtification to this faith of his, that God could give him a Son <hi>notwithſtanding the deadneſs of his own body and the deadneſs of</hi> Sarah<hi>'s womb;</hi> and then that he <hi>was able to raiſe him from the dead</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had offered him up, and ſo to raiſe a great Nation out of him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 19.11. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>James</hi> 2.21, 23. which was only or eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially an act of faith in the power of God; and theſe men impertinently carry it to ſomewhat elſe, which is uncertain, if not untrue.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſiſt only upon one more act of faith which was juſtifying, and yet was not chiefly conſiſting of a reſpect unto the blood of Chriſt, if it had that at all in it; and it is the faith of <hi>Noah,</hi> Heb. 11.7. <hi>By faith Noah being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his houſe, BY WHICH he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the world and BECAME HEIR OF THE RIG HTEOUSNESS WHICH IS BY FAITH.</hi> Here was a work of Faith in the threatning of a Flood, and precept of building of an Ark; and the ſtreſs of his Juſtification is chiefly laid upon his fear of Gods judgments and faithfull obedience to the command of building an Ark, (which proceeded from a firm belief of the threatning) and <hi>BY IT</hi> is ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an heir of the righteouſneſs w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is by faith</p>
            <p>I might likewiſe inſtance in the act of <hi>Rahab</hi>'s faith, which is ſaid to be juſtifying, <hi>James</hi> 2.8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſeems to have been only this, as appears by the ſtory, <hi>that ſhe received the Spyes,</hi> and truſted in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64817:154"/>Gods power for their and her deliverance; and in the faith of <hi>Phineas,</hi> who had ſuch a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious zealous faith, that he killed a Prince and a Princeſs at once with his own hand for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting lewdneſs; and this is ſaid <hi>to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him for righteouſneſs unto all generations for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 6.31. but I ſhall mention no more. But thus you ſee that there are other acts of faith unto which juſtification is imputed as well as the act of faith in Chriſts blood; therefore that is not the only act of juſtifying faith as ſuch.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, as it may well be, that theſe are inſtances of juſtifying faith in the dayes of the Old Teſtament, when faith in the blood of Chriſt was not ſo neceſſary, but now that faith in the blood of Chriſt is neceſſary, that is the only juſtifying act;</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. That for thoſe men that are moſt zealous for the opinion That faith as dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the death and blood of Chriſt is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act of faith as juſtifying, they hold that faith in Chriſt was as neceſſary under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto ſalvation as it is now; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe, I ſuppoſe, the inſtances of faith as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying, in other acts prove pertinently enough That faith in the blood of Chriſt is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act of juſtifying faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I affirm, that even in the dayes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel other acts of faith juſtifie beſides that by which we have immediate reſpect to the blood of Chriſt. I ſhall prove this ſecond Aſſertion by Argument and Scripture: 1. By Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</p>
            <p>Certainly in the times of the Old Teſtament,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64817:155"/>though (I verily believe that) ſaith in the death and blood of Chriſt was not neceſſary to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet <hi>they had ſomething in their faith that did anſwer our faith in the blood of Chriſt,</hi> as perhaps a reſpect to the mercies of God, and Gods readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be appeaſed; which readineſs in God was manifeſted by the Sacrifices which he had appointed. Now I will argue by analogie; If the Jewes had ſome ſuch like object for their faith as the blood of Chriſt is to us, and yet were not juſtified only by their fixing upon that object, but for other acts of faith, as is evident in the inſtances given, then nothing hinders but we may be juſtified by other acts of our faith, as well as that in the blood of Chriſt. I will give another argument to prove my Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſomewhat like this: We are commanded in the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 5.23. <hi>That all men ſhould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son as they honour the Father;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did <hi>Abraham</hi> glorifie God, ſo much as by his ſtrong faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. If therefore our duty be to honour Chriſt by believing, as ever any of the ancient Saints honoured God the Father, why will not the ſame faith in the power of Chriſt juſtifie, as did when it was placed in the power of God? which yet I have proved that it did juſtifie.</p>
            <p>Now for Scriptures, &amp;c. I ſhall give ſeveral inſtances of faith in the power of Chriſt, or at leaſt in ſome attribute and excellency of Chriſt beſides his blood, which juſtified; <hi>Luke</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. There was a great faith of the paralytick man, and his friends, that if he could but come to Chriſt he ſhould be healed; and therefore <hi>they opened the roof of the houſe, and let him down
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64817:155"/>through the tiling in his Couch; and when Jeſus ſaw cheir faith,</hi> (that is, of the ſick man and thoſe that brought him) <hi>he ſaid unto him, Man, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> Here is forgiveneſs of ſins, which is Juſtification, upon a faith only to be healed; whether it were in the goodneſs, or power of Chriſt, it was not faith in his blood, for this man was as ignorant of that myſtery (ſure) as the Diſciples of Chriſt were, who yet underſtood little or nothing of it. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.33, 34. I ſhall give but two inſtances more of this, and they are expreſly of faith in the power of Chriſt, as doubtleſs the former inſtance had much of this faith in it; it is in <hi>Math.</hi> 9.28, 29, 30. There are two blinde men healed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their ſight, and that purely upon their faith; which great mercy coming in upon their faith, was certainly a great token of divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, though indeed it be not then ſaid that their ſins were forgiven them. Now what is the proper object of their faith at this time? It is the power of Chriſt to help them. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, Believe yee that I am able to do this? They ſaid unto him, Yea Lord; then touched he their eyes, ſaying, According to your faith ſo be it unto you, and their eyes were opened.</hi> The laſt inſtance is of the Centurion's faith, which I muſt needs ſay I think as pertinent an inſtance as either of the two former, for his faith is highly approved of Chriſt, <hi>I have not found ſo great faith no not in Iſrael,</hi> as in this ſtranger to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and upon it ſpeaks of him and others, that are <hi>none of the children of the Kingdome,</hi> that is, not natural Jewes, that yet ſhall go to heaven before theſe that are; therefore I doubt not but this was a juſtifying

               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:64817:157"/>faith in the Centurion. Now let us ſee the compaſs of this Faith, or wherein it chiefly manifeſted it ſelf: Why it was onely in this, that Chriſt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cure his ſervant of the Palſie, nay he thought that diſeaſes were as much under the power of Chriſt to cure, as the Centurions ſervants were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him to command; he could make Diſeaſes come and go, as his ſervants would at his command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8, from the 5. to the 14.</p>
            <p>Having given inſtances of Faith in Chriſt which juſtifies, beſides Faith in his blood, I ſhall give one general proof from a moſt remarkable Scripture out of the New-Teſtament, for faith as juſtifying, which onely carries in it a dependance upon God and Chriſt in ſtraits, and perſecutions, and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: And indeed I muſt confeſs, the former inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not of ſo full proof to my particular, (though they are of good uſe) becauſe til Chriſt's death, faith in his blood was not ſo neceſſary (if at all neceſſary) to Juſtification, as afterwards; but this place which I ſhall now give, wil be beyond all exception; it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36, 37, 38. <hi>For ye have need of patience—for yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry: Now the juſt ſhall live by faith, and if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> here were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great perſecutions for the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and they were ſomewhat inclined to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, which here the Author of this Epiſtle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prevent by promiſes and threatnings; <hi>'tis but a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry;</hi> 'tis not long (ſaith he) ere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance wil come one way or other, either by the coming of Chriſt to judgement, or ſome temporal deliverance. In <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> it is, <hi>The Viſion is yet
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64817:157"/>for an appointed time, though it tarry, wait for it:</hi> And in the mean time (ſaith the Author of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) while the Viſion tarries, whilſt he that is coming, tarries, wait his coming, and endeavour to ſupport your ſelves by faith, <hi>for the juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> that is, Faith wil keep him alive in ſtraits: <hi>The life that</hi> I <hi>live in the ſteſh,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God:</hi> And ſaith <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk, Although the Fig-Tree ſhould not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vine, &amp;c.</hi> (when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a Famine) <hi>yet</hi> I <hi>will rejoice in the Lord,</hi> I <hi>will joy in the God of my ſalvation, Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. This could be done onely by ſuch a Faith as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are provoked to live by: This faith (you ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) by which the juſt live, may be as wel a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the goodneſs, and providence, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God to ſupport us in, or deliver us out of ſtraits and difficulties, as reſting upon the blood of Chriſt; and that this living by Faith upon the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, and goodneſs of God here ſpoken of, is an act of juſtifying-Faith, nothing is plainer, for that this is the great ſentence the Apoſtle quotes to prove Juſtification by Faith out of the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Rom</hi> 1.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. when yet the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon which it is delivered by <hi>Habbakkuk,</hi> ch. 2,4. was much like that of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is more of that place quoted in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> than in the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Galatians.</hi> Therefore if the Apoſtle would prove Juſtification by Faith out of this Scripture, he muſt at leaſt allow it as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying in that caſe, in which it is particularly uſed in the original place, which was reſting upon the providence of God in a time of danger; therefore reſting upon the providence of God in a time of danger, is an act of Faith as juſtifying, even in the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64817:158"/>dayes of the Goſpel; therefore there are other acts of Juſtifying-Faith even in the days of the Goſpel, beſides that of reſting upon the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Therefore my great Aſſertion is, That all acts of true Faith juſtifie, though there is (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) ſome ſpecial excellency in that act which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the blood of Chriſt; but if our Faith be but a right New-Teſtament-Faith, every act of it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies: As under the Old-Teſtament they that had all things that were eſſential to an Old-Teſtament Faith, were juſtified over and over, by every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed act of Faith, whether in one kind, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in one caſe, or another: One man's Faith ſhews it ſelf in a time of Famine, as <hi>Habbakkuk's;</hi> another in impriſonment, as <hi>Jonah</hi>'s and <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s; a third in leaving his Countrey when God calls him out, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s; or in believing he ſhould have a ſon born, when it was very unlikely; in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he ſhould have him again from the dead af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had killed him with his own hand, which was more improbable; another's Faith in building an Ark, as <hi>Noah</hi>'s; another in hiding of Spyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So now (I ſay) as it was then in the acts of an Old. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-Faith, it is in an anſwerableneſs in the days of the New-Teſtament; he whoſoever hath all the eſſentials of a New-Teſtament-Faith, is juſtified o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over a thouſand times, according to the renewed acts of Faith, if he believe as the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion did for his ſervant, or as the woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> did for her daughter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.28. or as the blind men did for themſelves; as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were to do in the power and goodneſs of God for their deliverance; or as the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſhould have done more in the death and blood of Chriſt, for they
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64817:158"/>did evacuate the death of Chriſt in the way that they went, <hi>Gal</hi> 2.21. I ſay, they that exerciſe faith in any of theſe acts, their faith is juſtifying in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of theſe acts; onely provided that the Faith be a true New-Teſtament-Faith, though I may affirm once for all, <hi>That there is no true faith in God, but in the dayes of the New-Teſtament (after ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) will prove a Faith in Chriſt, and of a right New-Covenant ſtrain.</hi> We ſee this proved by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in the Apoſtles days, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the Word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed;</hi>
               <q>That is, (ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his <hi>Paraphraſe</hi>) all they of the Gentiles that had any care or purſuit of the life to come, the Gentile-Proſelytes, or that were fitly diſpoſed and qualified for the Goſpel to take root in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Doctrine of Chriſt thus preached to them. In his Annotations upon this verſe he tells us, That this was Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s conjecture and that they were already believers.</q> So that their converſion was onely this, That their Faith which before was a Faith in God, now (through that diſpoſition and readineſs that it had in it to embrace all further diſcoveries of the Grace of God) turned into a Faith in Chriſt. Therefore I may ſay, where-ever there is any act of Faith in God, that act is juſtifying; and the reaſon now why every act of Faith exerciſed upon one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or another, doth juſtifie, is this, <hi>for that it is faith in us that is our Goſpel-Righteouſneſs;</hi> therefore whenever there is an act of this righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, there muſt eccho an act of Juſtification from heaven, according to the Law of the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is ſealed with the blood of Chriſt, that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64817:159"/>whoſoever believeth on God that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, or on Chriſt his Son, his Faith is counted to him for righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. or he ſhall not be aſhamed, <hi>Rom</hi> 10.11. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life, John</hi> 3.36</p>
            <p>As often therefore as thou doſt any action that doth demonſtrate this Faith in God, or Faith in Chriſt, ſo often are all thy fins pardoned, ſo often art thou highly approved of God, for there are theſe two things in juſtification: We ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified twice according to the expreſs words of Scripture; and there is a third act of his Faith recorded, his going out of his own Countrey, to which I doubt not might be accommodated that Scripture (which St. <hi>James</hi> onely accommodates unto a latter act of Faith, though it was in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal place ſpoken upon occaſion of a former) that then that Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteouſneſs:</hi> And as <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified twice, yea thrice, and that for ſeveral ſorts of acts of faith; and the other inſtances given both out of the Old and New-Teſtaments, for their various acts of Faith upon very different occaſions, yet all becauſe they agreed in the general nature of faith; ſo thou Saint, whoſoever thou art, do but live in the actings of faith, and thou art an haypy, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, approved, and juſcified perſon. All our life therefore ſhould be a life of faith; St. <hi>Paul</hi> lived no other life; <hi>The life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the ſaith of the Son of God, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing character, one or more (ſaith Mr. <hi>John Goodwin</hi> in his <hi>Banner of Juſtification diſplayed,</hi> p. 37.) <q>of juſtifying-ſaith which we are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64817:159"/>inquiring after, reſpecteth not the object, but the intrinſick nature or complexion of it; for at to the object, it is variouſly expreſt in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſometimes it is called <hi>a believing God,</hi> Rom. 43. ſometimes <hi>a believing on God,</hi> Joh. 12.44. ſometimes <hi>a believing on Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>on the Son of God,</hi> or <hi>on the Lord,</hi> Act. 11.17.

            <p>Now I find one Caution neceſſary to be given upon what I have delivered, which is this; That what I have ſaid of faith, that it juſtifies in every act of it, to the procuring pardon of ſins, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Approbation, doth not at all confound the acts of Faith, as if there were not a diſtinctneſs to be kept and obſerved in the actings of Faith; as ſome may have ſuch a groſs conception as this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſaid that the Centurion was juſtified for his faith in Chriſt for the healing of his ſervant, and the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> for faith for her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>Abraham</hi> for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for inſtance, I think it the duty of any that are enlightned concerning the corruptions of the Church of Chriſe, to believe that God wil deſtroy the <hi>Papal</hi> Hierarchy, and all the ſuperſtitious inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64817:160"/>into the Worſhip of God; yea, and I think to believe it ſtrongly at this time, when there is ſo great improbability of it, is mighty acceptable to God, and perhaps another ſuch act of Faith as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s was, that he ſhould have a ſon, and as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying. But now if one that hath lived wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but now is greatly convinced of his danger, as the Gaoler was, ſhould ask what he ſhould do to beſaved and juſtified, it were a ſtrange thing to put him upon this act of Faith, That God would deſtroy the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet may be an act of juſtifying-faith to another man; We would ſay to him, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did to the Gaoler when he asked this queſtion, <hi>They ſaid, Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, Acts</hi> 16.30, 31 Believe that the blood of Chriſt can waſh out as great ſtains as any of thy ſins have made; believe that Chriſt is willing to receive thee, caſt thy ſelf upon his mercy and goodneſs. Though every act of Faith juſcifie, yet there is a ſeaſon for every act of Faith: When the Centurion had a ſervant ſick, his act of Faith in the power of Chriſt was ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the womans faith for her daughter was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; the blind men's was ſeaſonable; <hi>Abraham's</hi> three acts were feaſonable; <hi>Noah</hi>'s, and <hi>Rahab</hi>'s, and that of <hi>Phineas,</hi> were all ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>Faith is a Divine faculty in the ſoul, which hath great variety of operations, e'en as many as the ſight hath objects, which are commended by the ſeveral ſeaſons and occaſions of acting: Faith in famine ſeeds us, in priſon it ſets us at liberty, in weakneſs of nature it ſtrengthens us, yea and in weakneſs of Grace too. Faith ſometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ixeth upon the Power of God, ſometimes upon the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſometimes upon the Faithfulneſs of God;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64817:160"/>ſometimes upon one attribute, ſometimes upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: Wee may ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. throughout the whole chap. what variety of glorious operations and effects Faith hath had; <hi>Through Faith they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, obtained promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſtopped the mouths of lyons, quenched the violence of fire, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their dead raiſed to life again, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 33. to the end. All which were juſtifying acts of Faith, onely they were ſeaſonable, and prudent; he that was caſt to the Lyons, did not believe to have the ſire quenched; and they that were caſt into the fire, did not believe to have the mouths of the Lyons ſtopped: Every act of faith is juſtifying; but then faith is as an univerſal faculty, which acts according to all the particular occaſions of the ſoul, and ſo it juſtifies:</p>
            <p>I ſhall now add ſomething of teſtimony out of Dr. <hi>More</hi> upon this ſecond queſtion, <hi>What acts of Faith juſtifie?</hi> becauſe I am very ſenſible that my anſwer to it may ſeem very ſtrange, and ſound ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry harſhly unto ſome good men; and I ſhall prove out of him, ſo far as his Authority wil prove it, That <hi>Abraham's</hi> act or acts of faith, which were juſtifying to him, were acts of faith in the Power, Juſtice, and Goodneſs of God, and that they juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie by ſuch their reſpect had unto theſe Attributes, as alſo, That <hi>our Goſpel-Faith, which indeed hath many new objects and encouragements offered to it,</hi> doth juſtifie onely by agreeing with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith in the general nature of faith, or (to uſe Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> words) <hi>in the intrinſick nature and complexion of Faith,</hi> which is ready to lay hold of all occaſions of diſcovering our true and hearty dependance upon God, acknowledging our own weakneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64817:161"/>all carnal confidence in any thing ſhort of the omnipotent Power and Goodneſs of God. And after theſe quotations out of him, I ſhal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſome other queſtions. In his <hi>Myſterie of Godlineſs,</hi> p. 379.
<q>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaith he) which is ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended by the Apoſtle, I ſay, it ſignifies nothing elſe but this in general, viz. <hi>An high ſenſe of, and conſidence in the Power, Juſtice and Goodneſſe of God, and a firm belief that he will aſſuredly bring to paſs whatſoever he hath promiſed, ſeem it never ſo unlikely and diſſicult to fleſh and blood:</hi> And this is that which is ſo highly commended in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it is plain in the 4th. to the <hi>Romans, who againſt hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many Nations; and being not weak in faith, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not his own body, now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, nor yet the deadneſs of Sardah's womb, being fully perſwaded, that what God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, he was ABLE to perform; and therefore</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> That is to ſay, God approved of him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In all this Juſtification of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there is not a word of the blood of Chriſt; for though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was the blood of Chriſt that procured <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> pardon (as a price) yet I doubt not but it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in the power and faithfulneſs of God that juſtified him. Again, pag 380: near the end of it:
<q>Thus (ſaith he) from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Abraham</hi> would the Apoſtle commend the <hi>CHRISTIAN FAITH</hi> unto the World, and in particular to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the off-ſpring of <hi>Abraham:</hi> For at the end of the fourth Chapter he makes this uſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith being imputed to him for righteouſneſs, that we might alſo be brought <hi>

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64817:161"/>UP JESUS CHRIST FROM THE DEAD, who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification.</hi>
               </q> As <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in the Power of God to give him a ſon, was juſtifying; ſo is our faith in the Power and Mercy of God (as having raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, who was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for our offences) juſtifying. Our faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chriſtian faith, hath ſomewhat more in it, than was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith; yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith proving Juſtification to him, we may well be encouraged to expect Juſtification in the way of a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaith.</p>
            <p>And pag. 381. he gives us another inſtance of a Goſpel-faith, which he parallels with the faith of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that is, A faith in the power of God to raiſe up Chriſt within us by his living Spirit, from the 11th. ver. of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. which I think is indeed rightly interpreted, though (with the favour of that great man) not ſo happily applied; but that I ſhall ſpeak unto, <hi>viz.</hi> wherein I differ from the Dr. upon the next queſtion: The words are theſe; <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up jeſus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his ſpirit which dwelleth in you; and if Chriſt be in you, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is dead becauſe of ſin, but the ſpirit is life becauſe of righteouſneſs, ver.</hi> 10. His interpretation of the verſe is excellent in my mind, and it is to this ſenſe as I apprehend it: That when we are Chriſtians, and have the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in us, and the preſence of Chriſt by his Spirit, we ſhall be ſenſible how far yet we remain unſanctified, and that unſanctified part in us which the Apoſtle calls the body of death, and deſires to be delivered from, will appear as ghaſtly and deadly a thing to us, as
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64817:162"/>the dead body tyed by <hi>Mezentius</hi> to the living, did to him, becauſe Chriſt is living in us: But yet now our Chriſtian faith teacheth us to believe, that though the body be dead becauſe of ſin, that is, there be a great part of us yet unſanctified and dead becauſe of ſinful remainders in it, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this unſanctified part or body of death in us, we are exceeding heavy and indiſpoſed to all holineſs and goodneſs, yet that the Spirit of Chriſt in us is life and righteouſneſs, and will by degrees qvicken thoſe very dead, unſanctified parts that are yet within us; <hi>for if the Spirit of him that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up Chriſt from the dead, dwell in us, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken our mortal hodies</hi> (that is, that unſanctified part that is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dead in ſin) <hi>by his Spirit which dwelleth in us.</hi> Dr. <hi>More's</hi> words are,
<q>We finding a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble warmth in the grateful arrivals of the holy Spirit, <hi>do believe,</hi> That he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, wil in due time even quicken theſe our mortal bodies, or theſe dead bodies of ours, and make them conſpire and come along with eaſe and chearfulneſs, and be ready, and active com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying inſtruments in alll things with the Spirit of Righteouſneſs. Which belief, <hi>viz.</hi> that God will thus by his Spirit quicken our mortal bodies, is (ſaith he) a chief point in the Chriſtian faith and moſt of all parallel to that of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> who believing in the goodneſs, and power, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, had, when both himſelf and his Wife <hi>Saraah</hi> were dry and dead, as to natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and ſo hopeleſs of ever ſeeing any frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And theſe now (according to the deſigne of the Dis Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) are acts of a Goſpel-faith, which juſtifie us, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s believing in the power of God for a Son did juſtifie him.</q> I come now to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtion, which is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How doth Faith juſtifie?
<note place="margin">The fifth queſtion of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</note> or under what notion and conſideration doth faith juſtifie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this I anſwer, that Faith juſtifies <hi>as</hi> our Righteouſneſs. It doth not juſtifie, as ſome affirm, only by relying upon the blood of Chriſt, or apprehending the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; for I have given inſtances of ſeveral acts of faith which were juſtifying acts, that had not this reſpect at all unto the blood of Chriſt, at leaſt not viſibly, and the <hi>reward of Juſtification</hi> was reckoned to them upon other accounts. <hi>Abraham</hi> was fully perſwaded that God was <hi>ABLE TO PERFORM,</hi> and <hi>THEREFORE</hi> it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21, 22. Yea, I have given inſtances of a faith in Chriſt that was juſtifying, and yet was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the blood of Chriſt, by any thing that appears in the Scriptures quoted. No, <hi>faith it ſelf is our righteouſneſs;</hi> faith in the power of God was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s righteouſneſs; and faith in the power of God, according as our neceſſities
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64817:163"/>at any time require, will be our righteouſneſs. But more eſpecially, faith in the power of Chriſt, or in the blood of Chriſt, is our Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs; though, as I affirmed before, <hi>there cannot be true faith in God now in the dayes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but it will turn into a faith in Chriſt as well as in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this Aſſertion, that Faith is our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, I ſhal give ſeveral Scriptures; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>What ſaith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs:</hi> that is, his believing in God, and relying upon his power and faithfulneſs for the fulfilling of his promiſe; this faith of his was accepted ſo farr, was ſo highly pleaſing to God, that God made him his <hi>friend,</hi> Jam. 2.22, 23. and reputed and reckoned him (through grace) as righteous as if he had kept the whole Law. So Rom. 4. ver. 5. <hi>To him that believeth in God, that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his faith is counted to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> What plainer expreſſion can there be than this for our Aſſertion? his faith is counted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to him, or for his righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And for a little proof from the teſtimony of others, for this Aſſertion (I reckon) is ſomwhat harſh, ſee what Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr <hi>John Goodwin</hi> ſay upon it.</p>
            <p>In his Aphoriſms of Juſtification, <hi>Theſis</hi> 20. <hi>pag.</hi> 108. ſaith Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi>
               <q>Our Evangelical righteouſneſs is not without us in Chriſt, as our Legal righteouſneſs is, but conſiſteth in our own actions of Faich and Goſpel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Theſis</hi> 23. <hi>pag.</hi> 125. In this ſenſe alſo, it is ſo farr from being an errour, to affirm
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64817:163"/>that <hi>faith it ſelf is our righteouſneſs,</hi> that it is a truth neceſſary for every Chriſtian to know; that is, Faith is out Evangelical righteouſneſs in the ſenſe before explained, as Chriſt is our Legal righteouſneſs.</q> And in the explication of this <hi>Theſis, pag.</hi> 128. he hath theſe words:
<q>Our Evangelical righteouſneſs, or Faith, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us for as real righteouſneſs, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, not that it is as much in true value, yet it is ſo accepted becauſe of the value of Chriſt's ſatisfaction.</q> 
               <hi>Theſis</hi> 57. <hi>pag.</hi> 225.
<q>It is the act of faith which juſtifies men at age, and not the habit; yet not as it is a good work, or as it hath in it ſelf any excellency above other graces: But 1. in the neareſt ſenſe, directly and properly as it is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the condition of the new Covenant: in the remote and more improper ſenſe, as it is the receiving of Chriſt, and his ſatisfactory righteouſneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>John Goodwin</hi> likewiſe declares himſelf not to be of their minde, who conceive or teach, That faith juſtifies as it is an inſtrument recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt's righteouſneſs, pag. 38. <hi>ult. Banner of Juſtification:</hi> therefore it muſt juſtifie as an act, which by God's ordination inveſteth us in the priviledges of Juſtification; therefore in his judgment faith it ſelf is our righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall adde no more in anſwer to thoſe men that hold, That Faith juſtifies only as it applyes the righteouſneſs or blood of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul; for I have ſhewn at large above, That faith juſtifies in other acts of it, beſides reſting upon the blood of Chriſt.

               </q> I need quote no more to ſhew the Doctor's notion, and apprehenſion of the whole buſineſs; but yet I ſhall <hi>ex abundanti</hi> quote ſome other paſſages. The Doctor you ſee is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64817:164"/>That Juſtification ſignifies making us juſt, holy, and righteous; and when we are made ſo, then God looks upon us as ſo, becauſe he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of things aright; and becauſe Faith makes us truly holy, inwardly juſt and righteous, therefore this righteouſneſs, by which we are thus inherently righteous, is called <hi>The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceouſneſs of Faith.</hi> For this ſee <hi>page</hi> 379. about the middle of it:
<q>
                  <hi>Abraham being not weak in faith, conſidered not his own body now dead, being fully perſwaded that what God had promiſed him he was able alſo to perform; and therefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs, that is to ſay.</hi> God approved of him <hi>FOR A GOOD AND PIOUS MAN,</hi> who not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulting with the natural improbability of the thing, but giving firm credence to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, did that which was due to the goodneſs and power of God, and <hi>BECOME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING A GOOD AND RIGHTEOUS MAN.</hi> So that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is <hi>NOTHING ELSE but to be approved as a good man, or a doer of that which is righteous and good, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does that which is good and righteous.</hi>
               </q> And afterwards in the ſame page, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Righteouſneſs of Faith and the Righteouſneſs of God is only a Chriſt-like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in man's ſoul, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:64817:165"/>Having given an account of the Doctor's judgment, I ſhall now ſhew in how many things I agree with the Doctor as to this buſineſs, and then where I conceive there needs ſome rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Doctor's notion: And firſt of all, I confeſs theſe are two <hi>GRAND PRIVILEDGES</hi> of the Goſpel (as the Doctor ſayes) viz. <hi>The forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> and <hi>The ſanctification of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> which latter the Doctor (as I doubt not) miſtakes to be meant by the word Juſtification in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I acknowledge, that true Sanctification is produced only by faith; <hi>purifying their hearts by faith,</hi> Acts 15 9. no other principle will work holineſs in the ſoul. <hi>The Law made nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> as to inward holineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I grant, that if true Sanctification ſhould be wanting from Faith, that Faith would not be a righteouſneſs, would not juſtifie; <hi>Faith without works is dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I allow that Works have ſome ſhare, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a ſecond place, in the matter of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>continued;</hi> ſo ſaith Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> often, and I think ſo ſaith St <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 2.24. <hi>Yee ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. I allow that Juſtification is attributed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in Scripture to a Work, the Faith not mentioned, though the Faith is underſtood, nay the chief honor belongs to faith, and the crown is to be ſet upon Faith's head, if we wili make a ſtrict and right interpretation of that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture whatever it be. Thus the act of <hi>Phineas</hi> in killing <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi</hi> is reckoned for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and yet no mention of his faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:64817:165"/>6.30, 31. <hi>Then ſtood up Phineas and EXECUTED JUDGMENT, and ſo the plague was ſtayed, and IHAT was counted unto him for righteouſneſs unto all generations for evermore.</hi> So very many of the actions in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. which are there by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Epiſtle reckoned to be the actions of Faith, and in ſeveral places of that Chapter ſaid to be imputed for righteouſneſs, <hi>verſes</hi> 4, 5, 7. yet in the original places, where their ſtories are recorded, not a word mentioned of their faith: Compare <hi>Abel</hi>'s hiſtory, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. compare <hi>Enoch</hi>'s, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Noah</hi>'s, Gen. 6.13, 22. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7, &amp;c. There is not a word mentioned of their faith in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> but only of their works, and yet their faith in thoſe works is plainly ſaid by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to be a <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith;</hi> Juſtification is indeed attributed to works, the faith not mentioned. And ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pardon of ſins and eternal life are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to other graces beſides faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Math.</hi> 5. from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. to <hi>ver.</hi> 11. for theſe two reaſons: 1. For that they have a ſhare, or a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place in the matter of Juſtification; but 2. and eſpecially, For that they neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe faith as being the fruits and iſſues of a true and lively faith.</p>

               <hi>there is none righteous, no not one:</hi> here the <hi>righteouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17. There is no other righteouſneſs takes place here.</p>
            <p>And to rip up the whole buſineſs again, which here I am put upon by the Doctor's aſſertion; and interpretations, though otherwiſe I might have gone on ſmoothly in my way.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, ſurely the Doctor will not deny that Juſtification and Sanctification have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent proper conceptions and notions, which they are to be underſtood by; that Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is God's pardoning our ſins, and receiving our perſons into ſpecial love and favour, that Sanctification is a mans likeneſs to God in his heart and life; or if the Doctor ſhould deny this, there are ſeveral places will evidence it. I ſhall name but two; <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it know: unto you therefore, Men and Brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins: and by him all that BELIEVE are juſtified FROM ALL THINGS, from which yee could not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law of Moſes:</hi>
               <q>That is, (ſaith Dr <hi>Hammond</hi>) ſhall certainly be freed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the wrath of God, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments attending ſin in another world, from which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could not by all its Ceremonies, Waſhings, and Sacrifices, purge or cleanſe us.</q> The other Scripture ſhall be that in <hi>Janes</hi> 12.24. <hi>Yee ſee then how that by works
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64817:166"/>a man is juſtified, and not by faith onely.</hi> Take Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation here for ſanctification, and let any one ſee if he can make ſence of it; nay it is plain in that Chapter that Juſtification is taken for being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved of God, and being made the friend of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>And the Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteouſneſs;</hi> and then (as it were exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical of that expreſſion) it is added, <hi>he was called the friend of God:</hi> But I know the Dr will allow of the particular without this proof, That Juſtification and Sanctification have theſe different and proper conceptions mentioned.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Certainly the Dr. will allow that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath a mighty vigorous and curious Diſcourſe concerning Juſtification, in its proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or its foreuſal acception, as the Dr himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it pag. 379. <hi>ad finem.</hi> The Apoſtle forms a profeſſed Diſcourſe, nay a Diſpute with the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Judaizing-Gentile,</hi> upon the buſineſs of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, taken for Divine approbation; they thought to obtain the favour of God one way, but he ſhews them another. Theſe two particulars I ſhall take for granted. Now I proceed.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, The Apoſtle therefore being to remove one way of <hi>Juſtification, viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Legalliſt,</hi> and to ſet up another, he makes mention of two Righteouſneſſes, one of the Law, the other of Faith: That of the Law, as I have ſhewed in the beginning of this Treatiſe, is a perfect conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Law, perfect inherent righteouſneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring obedience; this (ſaith the Apoſtle) no man hath, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>there is none righteous, no not one;</hi> and the Apoſtle in that third chap. of the <hi>Rom.</hi> by enumerating all ſorts of ſins which we are

            <p>The ſcope of the Apoſtles Diſcourſe (I doubt not) is this, That God hath deſigned and determined, that, ſeeing men have loſt their Original purity, and to can no longer ſtand upon their own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, he will take them off from it altogether, and make them live a life of pure dependance upon himſelf, and that is by faith, which muſt have holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life attending it; and thoſe that come off to do this, renounce themſelves, their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all creature-dependencies, and roll themſelves, and all their concerns, upon him, and upon his Son, though their imperfections may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>And this I ſuppoſe is no ſantaſtical notion of Juſtification by Faith, which I ſuppoſe the Dr. is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64817:167"/>chiefly ſet againſt; and ſeeing how many wayer men had corrupted the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, after he had ſolidly confuted their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, betakes himſelf to that of his own, which I dare ſay had no evil intention, though I ſtill affirm that it is moſt unhappily expreſt, and I cannot but read it with a great diſpleaſure and indignation.</p>
            <p>For to think that the Apoſtle ſhould make ſo much to do to decry the deſign of a legal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which in truth was no other in it ſelf but true and real, onely it muſt be) perfect holineſs, (however the Legalliſts all along in their purſuit after the Righteouſneſs of the Law, minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs) I ſay, for the Apoſtle to diſpute ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly againſt a Righteouſneſs by perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring obedience, under the name of one's own righteouſneſs, and to ſet up Faith as Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and yet that this righteouſneſs of ſaith ſhould ſignifie nothing elſe but thoſe poor inconſiderable effects of Faith in holineſs of life, which the greateſt part of Chriſtians attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to onely, this ſeems a mean buſineſs for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to labour about: Alas, 'tis true, Faith works holineſs, and <hi>all the great Legalliſts ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain by all their ſtir and ado, to ſo much true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as the meaneſt believer attains unto;</hi> but yet this which we attain, though by faith, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give name to a righteouſneſs in the ſight of God, for Juſtification; <hi>to be juſtified by, or for our holineſs of faith, is a low and baſe expreſſion of Goſpel-Juſtification.</hi> The righteouſneſs of Faith is an higher thing, when a man comes off from himſelf, and from all Creature-depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and profeſſeth to live upon the Power, and Goodneſs, and Faithfulneſs of God, and

            <p>I ſhall ſhut up this Queſtion with a grave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition out of Mr <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> in his <hi>Banner of Juſtification displaied,</hi> pag. 32.
<q>That Faith ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies (ſaith he) is the conſtant aſſertion of the Scripture, and the Architectonical doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 3, 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15.16. By the way, upon occaſion of theſe (with many the like paſſages in the New Teſtament, wherein Juſtification by faith is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> expreſly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) I cannot but mention my diſlike of their ſtrein in teaching, who lay down and deliver it to the people for a doctrine poſitively and plainly, That men are not juſtified by ſaith or by believing. Douotleſs it is not convenient or comely, poſitively to deliver or aſſert that for a doctrine of truth, which is ſo diametral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>uce this quotation to infirmate, as if the Doctor did not hold that we are juſtified by the acts of faith as well as by any other good actions, but for that I am ſenſible the Doctor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that we are not more juſtified by the acts of faith than by any other good actions; which
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64817:169"/>if it were true, I could not ſee how faith could be worthy of ſo famous attributious of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to it, in ſuch an eminent manner, when the Apoſtle is ſilent about other graces, only here and there in ſome places, where there is no ſuch profeſſed diſpute, he ſpeaks word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in Tayor of other graces and good works in the matter of juſtification.</p>
            <p>I tome now to a fifth Queſtion, which is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How do good works juſtifie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in anſwer to this I muſt firſt premiſe, That ſeeing the Scripture is ſo expreſs in it, that works to juſtifie, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Ye ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by ſaith only;</hi> I dare not paſs over this Queſtion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking to it. But I ſhall need to ſpeak the leſs to this, becauſe Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> and others have delivered ſo much upon it. I ſhall firſt ſhew the agreement which there is betwixt St <hi>Paul</hi> and St <hi>James</hi> in this buſineſs, and then ſhew how works juſtifie.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, St <hi>Paul</hi> aſſirms Rom. 3.28. <hi>chat we are juſtified by faith without the deeds or works of the Law.</hi> St <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>that we are juſtified by works and not by faith only;</hi> here ſeems to be a jarring and diſagreement. But they are to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by the obſervation of the ſeveral ſorts of works that theſe two Apoſtles ſpeak of. St <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of legal works or works of the Law, which contain in them an opinion of merit or debt, as I have ſhewn above, <hi>pag.</hi> 97, 98. and a man is juſtified without theſe, nay he cannot be juſtified if he but pretend to theſe. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> muſt ſpeak of another ſort of works, which, whileſt a man doth he yet renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64817:170"/>merit in them; and theſe works a man may be in part juſtified by, without any prejudice to the doctrine of Juſtification by faith. This is fully aſſerted by Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> Theſis 76. pag. 292.
<q>Neither is there (ſaith he) the leaſt appearance of a contradiction betwixt this and <hi>Paul</hi>'s do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. if men did not through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, negligence, or wilfulneſs over-look this; that in that and all other the like places the Apoſtle doth profeſſedly exclude <hi>THE WORKS OF THE LAW ONLY</hi> from Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but never at all <hi>THE WORKS OF GOSPEL</hi> as they are the condition of the New Covenant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Works therefore juſtifie as a leſs principal part of the condition of the New Covenant: I am not ſhy to ſpeak in Mr <hi>Baxter</hi>'s words, ſince I intend much the ſame thing; they do not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie from their own merit; ſo only legal works juſtifie, but from divine promiſe and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance. For proof of this that it is ſo, that works do juſtifie in the ſecond place, beſides the expreſs words of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> I finde the ſame thing aſſerted by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in three ſeveral Scriptures.

               </gap>aid to juſtifie, but it is a faith which worketh by love, a working faith. But yet more plainly the ſame expreſſion is uſed in two places to our preſent
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64817:170"/>purpoſe; Gal. 6.15. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any thing nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature;</hi> that is, (ſaith Dr <hi>Hammond</hi>) the renewed regenerate heart, and it may be added a new life. 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a now creature; old things are paſt away, behold all things are become new;</hi> that is, he lives a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect new life, and this new life only availeth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Juſtification beyond circumciſion or uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion which are meer external Priviledges. The third Scripture where the ſame expreſſion is uſed is beyond all exception to our preſent purpoſe: 1 Cor. 7.19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing and uncircumciſion is nothing,</hi> theſe are of no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the matter of pleaſing God, and obtaining his favour; What then is? why <hi>the keeping the commandments of God;</hi> this is beyond all theſe conſiderations of bond and free, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed and uncircumciſed. But theſe are the things with which he compares the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and good works: he doth not ſet theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, when he compares them with faith; in that place where he mentions faith, that is ſet above works and other graces, as the cauſe above the effect, the principal agent above the inſtrument; <hi>Neither circumciſion availeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing nor unc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſion, but faith which WORK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETH BY LOVE.</hi> But in theſe Scriptures we ſee plainly that work have an influence upon our Juſtification; they are of great availe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto it.</p>
            <p>If it be objected that the firſt Juſtification paſſeth upon believing before works, I anſwer, with many others, that there is in the firſt faith a rooted diſpoſition unto an univerſal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64817:171"/>there is the new creature or new man of the heart there, and in continued juſtification there is the new man of the life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons why the Lord would have works in the condition of Juſtification, though he doth not juſtifie for works only or chiefly, may be gathered out of the Scripture to be theſe:</p>
            <p>The firſt reaſon is this,
<note n="1" place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Why works are in the condition of Goſpel juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> For that without works faith it ſelf cannot be accounted a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſaith. Now certainly if faith juſtifie, it muſt be a perfect compleat faith, not a maimed imperfect faith. That without works faith is imperfect, and by works it is perfected, are the aſſertions of the Apoſtle <hi>James, Faith without works is dead.</hi> James 2.20, 26 <hi>&amp;</hi> ver. 22. <hi>Seeſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> how faith wrought with his works, and by works was his faith made perfect.</hi> What an uſelets imperfect dead thing is a power or faculty for action without operation? What an uſeleſs thing would it be for a man to have eyes able to ſee, only the man hath a continual blinde put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes that he never doth ſee in all his life? Why juſt ſuch a thing were faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our action, of no worth or uſe: What an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect faith had <hi>Abraham</hi>'s been if his works and actions had not attended it? Suppoſe we that when God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he had refuſed, and ſaid, Lord how then ſhall there ariſe of him a great Nation? his faith had been exceedingly diſcredited: But when he reſolves with himſelf, I will offer him up, for I know that God that raiſed him out of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s dead womb can as well raiſe him from the dead
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64817:171"/>after I have killed him and offered him up, here was a noble faith indeed, his faith was perfected by this work; here that grace ſhewed what it could carry men unto; <hi>When any thing attains its end it receives its perfection:</hi> Here faith attained its end in carrying <hi>Abraham</hi> to do ſo great a work, and therein was perfected, and ſo obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the compleat reward of Juſtification; then the Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God: if works had not accompanied his faith, it had proved but an imperfect dead faith, the Scripture had not been fulfilled which faith <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God. No artificer will own any thing to be a true and perfect piece of work which will not attain it's end, ſerve the uſe it is made for; ſo will not God own that to be faith which will not put us upon acts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in himſelf, and obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands be they never ſo difficult. For though God knows the heart, and ſo can ſee into the very principle of our actions, yet the Lord is pleaſed to keep that diſtance of State and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that he will not ſeem to know what he doth know, till the outward man expreſs what is in the inward man. God knew before what was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s heart, but yet he will not ſeem to know that he was ſo great a believer, till he had put him upon this trial of offering up his ſon; <hi>Gen</hi> 22.12. <hi>Now I know that thou fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not with-he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>hy ſon thine only ſon from me.</hi> Now I confeſs, what is here ſaid of works in this reaſon, That faith receives it's perfection from them, can only, properly and immediately be applyed to the works of faith, to other works only remotely, as faith
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64817:172"/>may have ſome kinde of influence even upon all good works, but however we ſee that faith is not perfect without ſome kinde of works. That is the firſt reaſon, Faith it ſelf would be an imperfect thing without works, and ſo could not juſtifie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon why works are taken into the condition of Juſtification is,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.</note> For that it were neither comely no nor poſſible for divine approbation (which I have often affirmed to be contained in Juſtification) to paſs upon any man without them. I put theſe two into one: 1. It were not comely; What a ſtrange thing would it be in the apprehenſions of men, if the great and holy God ſhould own a company of perſons in the world for his (for certainly whom he juſtifies he will own for his) that ſhould only be (though they really were) belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, but never do any ſervice for him? Neither plead for his honour when he is blaſphemed, nor own his ſervants when they are in reproach and diſtreſſed? Not to mention their negative holineſs, which lyes in avoiding the corruptions of the world; without which negative holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if God ſhould own them, he would be thought the Patron of all Vice, &amp;c. but I dare not expreſs the uncomly conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that would follow. Now beſides the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility that ariſeth from this uncomlineſs, there is alſo an impoſſibility that ariſeth from the nature of the thing, and that was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing I intended in this reaſon. I ſay therefore it is impoſſible that God ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of any perſon as juſt, or take him into his favor and delights (all which the Lord doth
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64817:172"/>in the great buſineſs of Juſtification) that is not a good and a righteous man. God cannot juſtifie the ungodly whileſt he remains ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he cannot love him, nor delight in him, nor approve of him, becauſe then he ſhould approve of and delight in that which were contrary to his own nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in a ſinfull wicked perſon, being himſelf an holy God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3.</note> Good works do not juſtifie only negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as without which faith would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and without which the object could not be beloved; but good works do help juſtifie, as that which (after the intervention of mercy and pardon) do render the object lovely to the holy God, and do naturally conciliate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love and approbation. 'Tis true, all our obedience, while it is any way defective, cannot conſtrain approbation and love from God, nay our defects muſt needs bring a guilt upon our beſt actions, if we are conſidered as under the law of our creation. But now, after that the good and mercifull God hath found out a comely way how he may ſhew favour to ſinners, it is certain that all their good actions (though they are not immediate acts of Faith, but of Love or Patience, Juſtice or Temperance) muſt needs be exceeding pleaſing to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meckneſs, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, againſt ſuch there is no law;</hi> that is, againſt ſuch graces and actions or perſons adorned with them there is no law. This is but a <hi>meioſis;</hi> for indeed ſuch graces and gracious perſons, though but imperfectly furniſhed with them, are yet for theſe things ſake (through his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:64817:173"/>acceptance of them) highly pleaſing to God. For this ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.4.</p>

I crave the pardon of that reverend perſon mentioned in that I take this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to expreſs my ſelf, I ſhall conclude this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with thoſe words of Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes, <hi>Theſis</hi> 73. <hi>pag.</hi> 289. <hi>&amp;</hi> 290.
<q>Faith <hi>ONLY</hi> doth not juſtifie in oppoſition to the works of the Goſpel, but thoſe works do alſo juſtifie as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coadary leſs-principal parts of the condition of the New Covenant.</q> I come now to the laſt Queſtion, which is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How comes faith thus eminently to intitule us to juſtification?.</hi> I have aſſerted,
<note place="margin">Queſt. 6.</note> that though works do juſtifie, yet faith doth it ſo eminently, as that gets the chiefeſt name of righteouſneſs, and works are never called our righteouſneſs, much leſs are they the righteouſneſs of faith; though it muſt be allowed as a good conſequence, that if we are ſaid to be juſtified by works, in a ſenſe works are our righteouſneſs, becauſe all Juſtification is by a righteouſneſs. But to let paſs that, that works are a partial, ſecondary, leſs principal righteouſneſs. The Queſtion remains, How comes faith to be ſo eminently our righteouſneſs, as to bear away the name, ſo that our righteouſneſs by which we are now ſaid to be juſtified ſhould be called the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of faith, in oppoſition to works, (that is) legal works.</p>
            <p>Now to this I anſwer: in the general, that the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64817:174"/>great reaſon of this muſt be the divine ordination and appointment. It could not be meerly from the nature of the thing: nothing in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can juſtifie a rational creature but perfect righteouſneſs, unerring obedience. Now the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faith in the world can never deſerve to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unerring obedience; faith was but a part of our duty which we owed to God under the firſt Covenant, that is, relying upon the power, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and veracity of God; and therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever faith comes to be our righteouſneſs, or our chief righteouſneſs, it argues that there is a great deficiency in the creature that is ſo to be juſtified; and accordingly the Apoſtle often glances upon this, that glorying is in this way excluded, <hi>not by the law of works, but by the law of faith.</hi>

            <p>Faith therefore cannot juſtifie by any natural excellency that it hath in it, for though all the men in the world being now ſinners and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to puniſhment by the law of their creation, ſhould reſolve of their own accord to believe that there is ſo much goodneſs in God that he will not deſtroy the work of his own hands, ſo depending upon his mercy, and therefore they will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do all thoſe things which they think may be pleaſing and acceptable to him, why all this faith and confidence, attended with the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience, will not extort a Juſtification from Almighty God, except it be in his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to juſtifie ſuch believers, and ſuch obedient perſons; becauſe they were all obnoxious to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the breach of his law. Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot juſtifie but by reaſon of divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and conſtitution that hath paſſed upon it, ſuch as this, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> and, <hi>That
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64817:174"/>if thou confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.9. and for this reaſon I ſuppoſe it is ſo often called <hi>Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Rom. 10.3. becauſe it was a righteouſneſs not in its own nature as works were, but a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs purely of divine appointment: This is Mr <hi>John Goodwin</hi>'s notion of it, Pag. 34. of the <hi>Banner of Juſtification displayed.</hi>
               <q>God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to decree, or make this for a law (which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>the law of faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27) that faith or believing in him through Chriſt ſhould intereſſe men in the benefit or bleſſing of the death and blood ſhed of Chriſt; that is, in that remiſſion of ſins which was purchaſed by his death. And in this conſideration faith juſtifieth, <hi>viz.</hi> by virtue of the Soveraign authority of that moſt gracious Decree or Law of God, wherein he hath ſaid or decreed, that it ſhall intitle men unto, or inright them in part and fellowſhip of that benefit of the death of Chriſt which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the forgiveneſs of ſins; or (which comes much to the ſame) as it is a qualification or condition, ordained, covenanted or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to bring upon thoſe in whom it ſhall be found the great bleſſing of that pardon of ſin which Chriſt hath obtained for men by his blood.</q> This is Mr <hi>Baxter's</hi> opinion too; that is, That ſaith juſtifies as it is made the chief condition of the N. Covenant. <hi>Page</hi> 225 of his Aphoriſms, <hi>Theſis</hi> 57.
<q>It is the act of faith which juſtifieth men at age, and not the habit, yet <hi>NOT AS IT IS A GOOD WORK;</hi>
               </q> (this is directly againſt Dr <hi>Moor's</hi> affirmation, who faith, that <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64817:175"/>good man, or a doer of that which is righteous and good, and that <hi>BECAUSE</hi> he doth that which is good and righteous; methinks here is a Juſtification for good works purely, and, if faith comes in here to juſtifie, it doth it only as it is a good work. Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> is of another minde, <hi>viz.</hi> That faith doth not juſtifie only under that <hi>qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>enus</hi> or reduplication <hi>AS</hi> a good work.
<q>Faith (ſaith Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> in the <hi>Theſis</hi> quoted) doth not juſtlfie <hi>AS</hi> it is a good work, or as it hath in it ſelf any excellency above other graces: But in the <hi>NEAREST SENSE DIRECTLY AND PROPERLY</hi> as it is the fulfilling the condition of the New Covenant, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But now though I have affirmed that it doth not juſtifie purely from its own nature,
<note place="margin">Though faith doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie purely from it's own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it hath a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in it ſelf which might ſomewhat recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> but chiefly from the ordination of God, and that it could not have juſtified without this ordination, yet I ſhall adde, that it had in its own nature a great fitneſs to be choſen of God for this eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to juſtifie men by. It was the fitteſt <hi>medium</hi> that we can imagine, when the firſt natural way of works failed, to promote the honour of God and the good of the creature in Juſtification; which conſideration commends highly the wiſdom of God in ſetting it apart for this uſe, as the chief condition of our Juſtification. To evince the truth of this, let us conſider a little the natural excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencyes that there are in faith.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all faith takes in all ſpiritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<note n="1" place="margin">Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Faith.</note> and repreſents them to the ſoul, ſo that all other graces are beholden to faith for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Heb. 11.1. <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> hope
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64817:175"/>could not be if faith did not give a real and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent being and ſubſiſtence to the things that we hope for, as alſo to all other the inviſible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen things which a Chriſtian, a Saint, as ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeth with and lives upon. Again, ver. 6. of that chap. 11. <hi>Without faith, 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God; For he that comes unto God muſt believe that he is</hi>—Now it is by faith that we believe and know that God is; ver. 27. <hi>by faith Moſes forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King;</hi> for he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible; by faith <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw him that is inviſible. I will acknowledge that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may finde out that there is a God, but if a mans wayes pleaſe God, his reaſon delivers over this obſervation to his faith, which is an higher thing, an higher principle in the ſoul then reaſon; though it never contradicts true reaſon, yet it is ſomewhat above meer reaſon
<note n="*" place="margin">If any one here will ſay that faith in ſuch a caſe (as the belief that there is a God) is much the ſame with reaſon or a rational conviction of the truth of ſuch a Propoſition I will not much contend, only becauſe here the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Penman ſayes <hi>it is by ſaith we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a God,</hi> and his aſſertion muſt have a truth in it, we may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Reaſon &amp; Faith thus, That Faith is a more particular faculty or habit of divine principles, ſuch as reſpect God, and Religion; but Reaſon is a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral faculty converſant about all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whatſoever; and this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt come in, That meer Reaſon only makes one a man, but Faith makes a man a Saint: and therefore this Faith muſt have a divine <hi>afflatus</hi> and ſpirit in it beyond meer reaſon.</note>.

Again, it is faith receives all the revelations of God by any meſſengers that he ſends unto us at any time
<note n="*" place="margin">And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fent to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony.</note>. <hi>Who hath BELIEVED our report</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaias</hi>) <hi>and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed,</hi> Iſai, 53.1. If the arm of the Lord be not revealed to men in the preaching of the word, it is becauſe they do not rightly believe the report. <hi>The word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with ſaith in the hearing of it,</hi> Heb. 4.2, 3. and hence it is, for that faith is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtrument of receiving the word of God, that the Saints in the New Teſtament are called as often by the name of <hi>BELIEVERS</hi> as by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other name, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. and the word of the Goſpel is called <hi>the word of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10.8.</p>
            <p>Nay, faith doth not only in the firſt place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God into the ſoul, then all the diſcoveries of God in his Works and Word, but it pitches upon all the particular objects that are there diſcovered in the Word, and brings them parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly into the ſoul; faith doth not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the doctrine of the Goſpel as true in the general, and from God, but becauſe Chriſt is there revealed, it receives Chriſt himſelf, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64817:177"/>brings Chriſt into the ſoul, and ſo <hi>Chriſt comes to dwell in our hearts by faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17. which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a figurative expreſſion; there is faith in Chriſt as well as faith in God the Father, and there is faith in the blood of Chriſt, &amp;c. but of theſe things I have ſpoken largely above in the laſt character, I bring them in only here as proofs of the excellency of faith, in that it brings all ſpiritual objects home unto the ſoul, that ſo the ſoul may converſe with them in the exerciſe of all its graces and virtues. In one word, our whole life here at a diſtance from God muſt neceſſarily be a life of faith, <hi>We walk by faith not by ſight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. for till we come to the beatifical Viſion of God, we muſt ſee him and all his glories and excellencies by faith; and our treatings with God the Father and the Son muſt be by faith: I have a long time dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved that Scripture, 1 Pet. 1.8 <hi>Whom</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>having not ſeen ye love, in whom though now you ſee him not, yet believing ye rejoice with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> Faith muſt come into ſet love on work upon an unſeen Chriſt, or elſe none of that glorious and unſpeakable joy could ariſe to a Chriſtian; ſo that by what hath been ſaid in this firſt particular, Faith is the root-grace in this preſent ſtate of things.
<note n="2" place="margin">Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Faith.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, Faith is not only the firſt grace in order and a root-grace, but it is certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive and efficacious in the actuating all other graces, and ſetting them on work; when once ſaith hath brought all theſe glorious objects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul, firſt God and all his glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, then his Revelations, and eſpecially Chriſt and his Blood, and realized them all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64817:178"/>the ſoul, it is almoſt impoſſible but all other graces ſhould in their ſeveral courſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which they have to theſe objects move and work regularly and intenſly. <hi>Love we know is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures it is the fulfilling of the Law perfectly even in degrees; in broken creatures it is the fulfilling of the Law ſincerely in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and endeavours. Now this faith makes its great inſtrument to work by. <hi>Faith worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. and I ſhewed above how faith ſets hope on work; now theſe three Faith, Hope, and Charity are the three great graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. all other graces are reducible to theſe three, and of theſe three faith is the root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. And therefore we finde often in the Scriptures that all Religion is put upon the bare aſſent of faith. Rom. 10.9. <hi>If thou confeſ; with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> 1 John 4.2. <hi>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come into the fleſh is of God.</hi> Not as if a meer confeſſion or profeſſion of Chriſt were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for there are many that do profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves Chriſtians that ſhall go to hell. But accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in the <hi>Romanes,</hi> if they did believe <hi>with their heart</hi> that God had <hi>raiſed Chriſt</hi> from the dead, together with the ends of his death &amp; reſurrection, certainly all thoſe other things which accompany ſalvation, or have ſalvation annexed to them, would follow; becauſe true ſaith, hearty, unſeigned faith is a working faith; it works by love to the making a man a new creature, and to the keeping of all the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64817:178"/>of God. And according to this poſitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I make no doubt that place in <hi>James</hi> is to be under ſtood, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. where there is a ſuppoſition of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration betwixt Faith and Works; that either that place ſpeaks onely of a falſe and onely pretended faith, and then indeed there may be ſuch a Faith without Works, a dead and unactive Faith, that is the reſemblance and appearance of Faith; or elſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t ſpeaks of a true Faith, and then it is onely by, way of ſuppoſition that the Apoſtle there ſpeaks, that upon ſuppoſition any one's Faith (though it were the higheſt and trueſt Faith in the World) ſhould not be accompanied by Works, it would not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and it is very true upon that ſuppoſition: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Works are as well required as Faith; not but that where-ever there is a true and lively Faith, there will be Works neceſſarily attending it; and this I believe all will readily acknowledge.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is ſo much of this opinion that Faith is an operative Grace; and puts the ſoul, where it is, upon gracious actions towards God, that be puts works and obedience into the deſinition or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Faith. In his Aphoriſms, pag. 279<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Theſis</hi> 70.
<q>Faith (ſaith he) in the largeſt ſenſe, as it comprehendeth all the condition of the New-Covenant, may be thus defined: It is, when a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the Word and Spirit of Chriſt being throughly convinced of the righteouſneſs of the Law, the truth of its threatning—the Nature and Offices, Sufficiency and Excellency of Jeſus Chriſt—his free offer to all that will accept of him for their Lord and Saviour, doth hereupon believe the truth of this Goſpel, and accept of Chriſt as his only Lord and Saviour to bring him to God his chiefeſt good—and doth accordingly
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64817:179"/>reſt on him as his Saviour, and <hi>SINCERELY,</hi> (though imperfectly) <hi>OBEY</hi> him as his Lord; <hi>FORGIVING OYHERS, LOVING HIS PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE, BEARING WHAT SUFFERINGS ARE IMPOSED, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> and all this ſincerely, and to the end. This is part of his deſinition of Faith. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in another place, pag. 238. <hi>Theſis</hi> 62. according to this definition of Faith tells us,
<q>That Faith may be called the onely condition of the New-Covenant for two reaſons; 1. Becauſe it is the principal condition, and the other but the leſs principal; and ſo as an whole Countrey hath oſt its Name from a chief City, ſo may the conditions of this Covenant from Faith. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the reſt are reducible to it, either being preſuppoſed as neceſſary antecedents or means, or contained in it as its parts, properties, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications, or elſe implyed as its immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</q> or neceſſary ſubſervient means or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. And ſo full to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Theſis</hi> 73. pag. 280. Thus we ſee by Scripture, and according to the opinion of a very learned and good man, that Faith is not onely the firſt Grace in order, but a very operative Grace, and was in its own nature exceedingly ſitted for that ſervice which God hath in much Wiſdom and Prudence appointed it unto.</p>
            <p>But thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> there is yet a more proper reaſon then either of theſe, why Faith ſhould be choſen for this uſes and that is, for that Faith is a ſelf-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Grace; to live by Faith, is to live purely in dependance upon God and Chriſt for every thing; and what fitter inſtrument or condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication could be choſen after the fall of man, when it was moſt reaſonable that if God would ſave a man, he ſhould have all the glory? Doth not the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64817:179"/>Apoſtle inſiſt mightily upon this, both in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and particular practice? <hi>Juſtification now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Eph. 2.9. <hi>But by Grace are ye ſaved through Faith.</hi> So <hi>Nom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excluded. By what Law? Of works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> This is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine. Then for his practice; <hi>For my part</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, I am</hi> a poor dead thing; <hi>Nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, or no longer I, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life that I live, is by Faith in Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Now that St. <hi>Paul</hi> is come to live the life of Faith, he is nothing, Chriſt is all; he is dead, and liveth not, Chriſt onely liveth in him. So that you ſee Faith, beſides all its other excellencies, hath a peculiar fitneſs for this ſervice of juſtifying a ſinner; and yet notwithſtanding all theſe excellent qualities that are to be found in Faith, it could not have juſtified without a Divine ordination and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Now for any to ſay (as ſome do) that Love juſtifies as much as Faith; nay that God doth rather approve of a man for his Love, then for his Faith, is (methinks) very bold and unſcriptural Divinity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely adde a word of teſtimony out of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to this laſt particular, and ſo conclude the queſtion, and all the queſtions which I have to propoſe about Juſtification. Pag. 231. of his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms he hath theſe words:
<q>If God had ſeen meet to have ſtamped any thing elſe <hi>to paſs for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it would have paſſed currantly; yet take this, Faith is, even to our own apprehenſion, the moſt apt and ſuitable condition that <hi>GOD COULD</hi> have choſen (for as far as we can reach to know) there cannot be a more apt or rational condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—pag. 232.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64817:180"/>This is the moſt ſelf-denying and Chriſt-advancing Work. Nothing could be more proportionable to our poverty, who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to buy with,</q> than thus freely to receive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done with all the Queſtions which I thought any ways neceſſary to be ſpoken to for the more particular and diſtinct unfolding of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification; and I might here ſhut up the Diſcourſe with the Uſes of the whole. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the Uſes, I judge it convenient to add ſomewhat by way of Appendix; concerning the means or way how Juſtification came to be transferred from the Law to the Goſpel, or from Works to Faith, for that I have acknowledged that Works and the Law were the firſt natural way of juſtifying men, but now that it is altogether brought about by Grace and Faith. That which I have to ſay, I ſhall introduce with this objection.</p>
            <p>If we were all born under the Law,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> and bound to obey it to a tittle, upon which obedience it ſhould have juſtified us, but upon the leaſt breach was armed with this threatning, That we ſhould dye the death; and that we have all broken it, how comes it to paſs that we are not all the Laws Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Priſoners, and condemned by it? How came there ſuch eaſie gracious terms to be offered us for our juſtification, as Faith and ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that theſe ſhall be accepted inſtead of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unerring obedience? How will this way be for the honor of God's veracity in the threatning, or his holineſs, to take imperfect ſinful creatures into favour?</p>
            <p>Now in anſwer to this objection I ſhall not need to meddle with that queſtion,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> whether it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64817:180"/>with the natural Juſtice or Holineſs of God, conſidered as antecedent to his threatning, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of puniſhing ſinners with death, for him to have pardoned ſinners by an abſolute Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Grace, and ſo to have received them into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour upon their repentance, without the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Saviour.</p>
            <p>But in the firſt place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſeeing there was adecree paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>In the day that thon eateſt, thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> Gen. 2.17. I ſee not how it was conſiſtent with the veracity of God to remit the ſinner without any conſideration at all, without a very conſiderable fulfilling of this threatning.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The threatning therefore was fulfilled theſe ſeveral ways; 1. Upon man himſelf in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for that preſently upon man's fall inſued his mortality, and all the inconveniences and troubles which we meet with in the World, which are the fore-runners and cauſes of our diſſolution. But ſecondly, and eſpecially, the great God, in infinite Wiſdom and Mercy, provided a Saviour, one migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſave, that ſhould come into the world in the fulneſs of time (about the 4000th. year of the World, the World being to laſt but perhaps 7000. years in all) and free us that were born under the Law, and by our ſins made obnoxious to the curſe of it, from the curſe and power of the Law. Now this being the great means of transferring Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from the Law to Faith, I ſhall a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the Explication of it. That which I have to ſay upon it, will be contained in theſe two aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Chriſt in his own perſon here upon earth, undertook the Law, and anſwered it in all that it had to ſay againſt us: And whereas it was
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64817:181"/>a killing letter, he took out this condemning power of it for all believers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this was done by Chriſt for all ages of the Church; and ſo it was, and is the great foundation of that Juſtification by faith which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> contends to have been in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, before the Law, under the Law, and in the dayes of the Goſpel to the end of the world; ſo that the way of Juſtification by faith comes in kindly, and in a comely manner, without any neglect or violation of the Law: I begin with the firſt aſſertion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Chriſt in his own perſon here upon earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook and anſwered the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The firſt aſſertion, That Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook &amp; anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the law for us.</note> &amp;c. Now to prove
and illuſtrate this aſſertion, it will be uſefull to us, 1. To conſider in what condition the Lord Chriſt found us when he came into the world as a Saviour.</p>
            <p>We were therefore all of us Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<note place="margin">We were all under the law when Chriſt came to ſave us.</note> priſoners to the Law. I ſhall give the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this in the Apoſtle's expreſſions (which are ſomewhat myſtical) to which I hope I ſhall adde ſome light by laying them together, and comparing them one with another. Before Chriſt came, and before faith came, and ſo at the time when Chriſt came, &amp; when faith came in the doctrinal diſcovery, or at any time doth come to us in the hearty cloſing with it, <hi>We were kept under the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.23. the words are <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And our Saviour tells us what he was commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated to by his Father; Luke 4.18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor, he hath ſent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES, and recovering of ſight to the blinde, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed</hi> (or <hi>bound,</hi> as it is in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1.) <hi>to preach the acceptable year of the Lord;</hi> that is the Year of Jubilee, when all ſervants were ſet free: thus Chriſt's coming was to proclaim a Year of Jubilee to the whole world, that the Law's Captives ſhould be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and thoſe that ſerved God under the tyranny of the Law might receive a ſpirit of Adoption.</p>
            <p>So now thus farr we are gone in our proof of the firſt aſſertion, that when Chriſt came as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Redeemer of his people, he found them all under the Law, as the lawfull Captives and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners unto it by reaſon of their ſins, which were tranſgreſſions of the Law. Now therefore what remains but this, that if Jeſus <hi>will ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> if he will deliver the Law's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, he muſt make ſatisfaction to the Law?</p>
            <p>The Law was ſuch a thing as muſt not be dealt with in a way of violence: 'tis true, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour came to redeem us from the power of Satan, he did that by an holy violence, he fought with all the powers of hell upon his Croſs, and conquered them by force of arms (as I may ſpeak) <hi>and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64817:184"/>over them in himſelf, or in his Croſs;</hi> but now the Law muſt be taken off in a more honourable way: for the Law had an authority in it, the Law was nothing but the will of God revealed <hi>for mans life, with a reward and threatnings annexed;</hi> ſo that the great God himſelf ſtood up in vindication of his own Law, that if the Priſoners of it were reſcued, it muſt be upon ſuch terms as theſe, which appear what they were by the event.</p>
            <p>That he that is the Saviour of the Law's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives muſt firſt be <hi>made under the Law</hi> himſelf.
<note place="margin">The terms upon which the Law's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives be delivered.</note> 
               <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly, That he muſt paſs thorough a legal Juſtification himſelf, before he can take others off from the Laws condemnation; for being made under it, the Law muſt either juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him or condemne him, which latter it did not for any perſonal breach that he made of it, therefore it muſt and did acquit him.</p>
            <p>But then for us who were under the curſe of the Law, if he will deliver us from it, he muſt <hi>be made a curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.13. if he will ſave us from our ſins, which were invigorated by the Law, with a ſentence of condemnation (all the ſtrength of ſin for condemnation being in the Law) he himſelf muſt <hi>be made ſin</hi> (that is, as much as an immaculate Lamb could be) <hi>viz.</hi> a ſin-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>he was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> that is, that we might be made righteous by Gods accepting Goſpel conditions, inſtead of legal, for our Juſtification.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt will redeem us from the wrath of the Law, which is the wrath of God <hi>(the Law
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:64817:184"/>worketh wrath,</hi> Rom. 4 15.) truely he muſt come under that wrath ſo farr as it was poſſible for ſuch an innocent perſon to be under it; and we know that he was under as horrible a deſertion as ever any that truſted in God was under; and that at ſuch a time when he needed the greateſt ſupports, even when he hung upon the Croſs, crying, <hi>My God, My God,</hi> (words of an high ſaith) <hi>why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> words expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a moſt dreadfull deſertion, <hi>Math.</hi> 27 46. Not to mention his agony in the Garden, which was but a fore-taſte of that Cup which he was afterwards to drink off.

               </gap>? No; though he were equal with God, though he were God's Fellow (as here the Lord calls him) yet <hi>he made it not a prey or a robbery to be equal with God,</hi> ſo as to hold it faſt, and ſtand it out, but gave way; he knew what he had undertaken, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem Captives indeed, but it was from under the Law, the righteous and holy and pure law of God, and this muſt not be violated, this muſt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.

                  </gap>ailing it to his Croſs.</hi> Now this was the manner of Chriſt's enervating the Law, and leaving it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, or obligation upon us to puniſhment, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Rom</hi> 76. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Law is made of no ſtrength againſt us, ſo it might be rendred, though the Tranſlation is this, <hi>we are delivered fram the Law,</hi> the Law can hold us captives no longer, it is made a weak, and a vain thing to us, having ſpent all it's rage &amp; fury upon Chriſt; for the Law could do no more then it did
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:64817:185"/>upon Chriſt; what can the Law do more to a debtor, nay to any malefactor, then arreſt him, bring him to trial and execution? and all this the Law, did upon Chriſt, as our <hi>ſurety,</hi> and ſo left no ſtrength, or vigour in it ſelf againſt thoſe whoſe Surety he was.</p>
            <p>The Law when it fell upon us it left us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, Rom. 5.6. <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly;</hi> but when Chriſt comes to deal with the Law, he leaves the Law without ſtrength; nay, though he offered no affront or violence to the Law, yet he left it for dead, as it is Rom. 7 6. <hi>Now we are delivered from the Law, THAT BEING DEAD WHEREIN WE WERE HELD.</hi> The Law that fell upon us when we were weak was taken by the Captain of our ſalvation, and left for dead; nay, he made it ſuffer the ſame death that it put him to. The Law nailed Chriſt to the Croſs, and Chriſt nailed the Law to the Croſs, and all this without violence or affront offered to the Law, it being but naturally conſequent upon what the Law did firſt to Chriſt; for if the Law ſet upon Chriſt as our Surety, and do the utmoſt to him that it can, it muſt needs follow that it hath no ſtrength left againſt thoſe for whom he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, and ſo muſt die and expire by the ſame death that our Saviour dyed, it being nailed to the Croſs, which is but a ſigurative expreſſion.</p>
            <p>And yet I ſhall carry the Allegory a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, herein ſtill following the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Is it any wonder now, is it any unreaſonable thing, now that the Law is dead, <hi>and taken out of the way,</hi> that we ſhould be married to another hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? that we ſhould reckon our ſelves to be
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64817:186"/>no longer under the Law. <hi>The woman which hath an husband</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23.) <hi>is bound by the Law to her husband ſo long as he liveth, but if the husband be dead ſhe is looſed from the Law of her husband; So then, if while her husband liveth ſhe be married to another man, ſhe ſhall be called an adultereſs; but if her husband be dead, ſhe is free from that Law, ſo that ſhe is no adultereſs though ſhe be married to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>Wherefore my brethren, ye alſo are become dead to the Law,</hi> or the Law is become dead to you, <hi>BY THE BODY OF CHRIST, that ye ſhould be warried to another, even to him that is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> The Law is every ſoul's firſt Husband, &amp; ſince the fall, &amp; ſo every one's actual ſin, the Law is an intolerable husband, there is no living with it, it ſo ſets on guilt &amp; preſſeth the ſoul w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> terrors; nay, inſtead of producing good works, (the natural fruit of this Marriage-relation of the Soul to the Law whileſt in innocency) it now produceth all manner of luſts, according to the 5. ver. of that 7. chap. <hi>When we were in the fleſh, the MOTIONS OF SINS WHICH WERE BY THE LAW did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</hi> Now God, in much mercy to mankinde, finding that if the Law and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or ſoul of man keep together, his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be loſt, and himſelf loſe thoſe fruits of good works which the ſoul was firſt created for, he provides another husband for the ſoul which is Jeſus Chriſt; only Chriſt muſt redeem his Spouſe from that tyrannical Husband which now it lives with, elſe the Soul ſhall be but an Adultereſs to pretend marriage to Chriſt, that is, the way of grace, whileſt the Law can make
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64817:186"/>a juſt claim to her as a wife, which it might have done as long as it lived. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the reſcue I have before declared, it was by ſuffering and yielding to the Law, yet ſo as in it the Law deſtroyed it ſelf, and then is it lawfull for the Soul, that was before wife to the Law, to be married to another husband, and who ſo fit as he that redeemed her? Now the Soul ſhall have it's forbearance under failings, which the Law would not endure, and God ſhall have a kindly and ingenuous Service; there will be <hi>fruits unto God:</hi> and this is the paſſage from Works to Faith, from the Law to Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I though the Law</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>am dead to the Law, that I might live to God,</hi> Gal. 2.19. that is, through what the Law hath done to Chriſt it hath nothing to do with me. <hi>But now we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we ſhould ſerve in newneſs of spirit and not in the oldneſs of the Letter,</hi> Rom. 7.6.</p>
            <p>One Scripture more to this purpoſe, it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. &amp; 23.4. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to ohem which are in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (who are married to Chriſt and have accepted the terms of the Goſpel) <hi>who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit; for the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath made me free from the Law of ſin and death:</hi> this chiefly relates to ſanctification, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward law or power of corruption, which was occaſionally and accidentally ſtrenghtned by the Law of God, was now broken by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power, ſpirit, and life which is conveyed by the Goſpel of Chriſt, and is called <hi>the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>for what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh,</hi>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:64817:187"/>(that is, it could neither juſtifie nor ſanctifie) both theſe did God bring to paſs by <hi>ſending his Son in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh,</hi> when <hi>for ſin,</hi> that is, Chriſt's making himſelf a Sin-offering, &amp; ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Law, <hi>God condemned Chriſt in the fleſh:</hi> that is, deſtroyed it, both in the guilt and power of it, out of us that were ſinners; ſo it follows, <hi>that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit;</hi> that is, that the Law might no longer accuſe us being anſwered by our Saviour, and that we might attain to that which is the chief deſigne of the Law, to wit, righteouſneſs and holineſs, which if we had continued under the Law we could never have attained unto.</p>
            <p>What ſo common now with the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> as to tell them, that now <hi>they are not under the Law, but under grace</hi> by this means, namely, the <hi>BODY OF CHRIST</hi> offered; and that therefore <hi>there ſhall be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> and that <hi>therefore ſin ſhall not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them,</hi> which are the two great effects of the death of Chriſt, though the firſt chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to that ſubject which I am upon; <hi>viz.</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification?</p>
            <p>Having given now all theſe things in an alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical and myſtical dreſs, (yet herein only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Apoſtle) I ſhall deliver the ſame thing ſomewhat plainly, and ſo conclude this firſt particular.</p>
            <p>The ſumme of all this is, Man was made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, had a Law to live by, to which there was a threatning annexed, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt die the death, or ſhalt ſurely die</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">This threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (I take it) is due by the Law to &amp; intended againſt all ſins, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> Ro. 6.23. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſin indefinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beſides wiſe <hi>Adam</hi> might have committed any other ſin and not have dyed.</note>. Man did eat, and ſo was to die, death accordingly entred by
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:64817:187"/>this ſin into the world, that is a natural death, and for eternal death hereafter, and the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death of the ſoul here, which conſiſt's in ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enations from God; (both which all men at age are obnoxious unto being ſinners, as for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I neither affirm nor deny any thing) the Lord in mercy deſigning to deliver men from, provided a Saviour, who ſhould firſt live a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect life, that ſo he might be the more acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable Sacrifice; and his terms of ſaving men muſt be theſe, that he muſt freely offer himſelf up to God a Sacrifice for our ſins, give his life a ranſome, &amp;c. and though the Father loved him all the while (as I cannot admit that the Father was really angry with Chriſt, or that he taſted the Fathers wrath, for God could never be angry with one that never diſpleaſed him) yet undertaking ſuch a load as our ſins, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would deal with him much like as with a ſinner, leave him to men and devils upon the Croſs, and with-draw the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which forced thoſe ſad out-cryes upon the Croſs. Now upon condition of Chriſt's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this great ſervice (which was, as I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, the chiefeſt deſigne of his coming into the world, <hi>for this cauſe came I to this hour,</hi> John 12.27. though there were divers other great deſignes of his coming) I ſay upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of performing this great ſervice the great God of heaven would reckon that his word of threatning was fulfilled, and the holineſs of his Law ſatisfied in this eminent ſignification of his diſpleaſure againſt ſin ſhewn upon his own Son, (whom he would not ſpare when he had taken our ſins upon him) and for ever after would
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:64817:188"/>grant this new and living way of Juſtification unto the world, <hi>THAT WHOSOEVER SHOULD BELIEVE AND OBEY SIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEREEY</hi> ſhould be juſtified and ſaved; and that for all ſuch, they ſhould be no longer under the Law for their Juſtification, but under Grace. And I can underſtand no other ſenſe of the Law's being dead, and <hi>Grace it's reigning through righteouſneſs unto eternal life by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only need to minde one thing before I go off from this particular,
<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the great Priviledge of freedom from the Law.</note> and that is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this priviledge of freedom from the Law. And they are only ſo many as put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the way of believing for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all others are really under the Law ſtill; <hi>When we were in the fleſh the motions of ſins which were by the Law did work in our members, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 7.5. All that are in the fleſh are under the Law ſtill; <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we are delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held.</hi> The Law was alive before to their conſcience, whileſt they were in the fleſh, and out of Chriſt, but now the Law was become dead to them; which plainly argues that the Law is dead or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to men in the condemning power of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtate that a man is in, either of ſin or holineſs: So Rom. 6.14. <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grace;</hi> plainly implying, that if they were under the Law ſin would have dominion over them, an alſo that if ſin had dominion over them, it were a plain ſigne that they were under the law. This being a great truth in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That <hi>all that are not ſerving God in the way of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64817:188"/>faith are under the law;</hi> for that the law is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way which a man is born under, and the way of faith and grace a ſuperadded diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon conſideration of the death of Chriſt for all thoſe that ſhould believe and obey ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely; therefore, till they get into the way of believing, they muſt be in that ſtate which men are naturally born under, that is, under the law. I ſhall conclude this particular with a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage about Dr <hi>Preſton,</hi> I have heard it affirmed by one that was contemporary with Dr <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> a perſon of credit and worth, that he heard him preach to this purpoſe, That Chriſt dyed to make this Propoſition true, that, <hi>WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH SHALL BE SAVED.</hi> Now this I ſuppoſe is full to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for proof of what I am upon, That Chriſt dyed to buy a people off from the law, that they might be juſtified by faith; he dyed to buy thoſe off from the law that ſhould prove belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; as for all others he leaves them to the law ſtill. For Chriſt did not dye to get the law an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, or made utterly void; <hi>Do we make void the law? God forbid,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. but <hi>he laid down his life for HIS SHEEP, and to ſave HIS PEOPLE from their ſins;</hi> he bought them off from the law, ſuch as St <hi>Paul, I through the law am dead to the law;</hi> but not for wicked men, that is, ſuch, as continue ſo, they ſhall finde the law alive to them, and full char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with wrath againſt them; it being nothing elſe but the holy will of the great God, unto which all his creatures owe an exact confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>Now by what hath been ſaid, I ſuppoſe is
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64817:189"/>plainly and fully proved <hi>that which I made my firſt aſſertion,</hi> viz. That Chriſt Jeſus in his own perſon here upon earth underlook and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the law for all believers, ſo that they may be juſtified, for any accuſation that the law hath to charge them with; and thus they come under grace and into this eaſier and ſweeter way of Juſtification in a comly manner, the law being honourably taken off; So <hi>that</hi> now <hi>God may be juſt,</hi> that is, <hi>mercifull</hi> (ſaith Dr <hi>Hammond</hi> upon the place) <hi>and the juſtifier of every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3 24, 25, 26. <hi>He may now ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4.5. which by the law, if that had not been taken off by Chriſt, he could not (I think) have done. Methinks what I have ſaid ſhould be a clear proof of this aſſertion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have not only proved that it is ſo, but ſhewn out of the Scripture the very manner how the law was taken off.</p>
            <p>All that I can apprehend to remain any whit doubtful or queſtionable is this, How doth it appear that what Chriſt did in ſuffering under the law, being under the curſe, &amp;c. did reach to the times that were before Chriſt's coming into the world? it may be eaſily conceived how it makes clear way for our Juſtification by faith, who have lived ſince his death; for if he <hi>bare our ſins,</hi> the law will not charge them upon us; if he dyed <hi>for us,</hi> or in our ſtead, we are not by the law to die; if Chriſt were <hi>ſacrificed for us as our Paſsover,</hi> we need not fear (if we have the Goſpel-conditions of Covenant-relation to God in Chriſt) but the deſtroying law will paſs over us; ſee how the word <hi>Paſsover</hi> comes from <hi>paſſing over,</hi> Exod. 12.21, 23, 27. But how doth
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:64817:189"/>it appear that this death of Chriſt had this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the times of the Old Teſtament, to bring in the way of Juſtification by faith to them? for that you have aſſerted that the way of Juſtification by faith hath been in all ages, both before the law, and under the law, as well as now in the dayes of the Goſpel, and that none was ever juſtified in any other way. Now how were they taken off from the law and brought under Juſtification by faith? or how doth it appear that the death of Chriſt was the foundation of this way of Juſtification by faith even to them? And unto the aſſoiling of this difficulty I ſhall now addreſs my ſelf, that is to the proof of my ſecond aſſertion, which was this. What was done by Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and anſwering the law, was done for all ages of the Church; and ſo it was, and is the great foundation of that Juſtification by faith, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> contends to have been the only way of Juſtification in all ages. And for proof of this I offer theſe things to conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Saines in all ages before the death of Chriſt had this way of Grace then as well as we have it now (that I have proved at large in the beginning of this Treatiſe) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whence had it they but from this death of Chriſt which was certainly to follow at a prefixt time?</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid they had their way of Grace purely from the goodneſs of God, I oppoſe, 1. That if ſo many thouſands vvere ſaved before by meer grace vvithout the conſideration of a Saviour, vvhy had not the Lord continued the ſame grace unto the end of the vvorld, vvhich
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:64817:190"/>we ſee he hath not continued? Why are the vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafements of Gods Grace in pardon of two ſuch quite different kinds, ſo as to ſave his people for 4000. years without a Saviour, and the reſt by a Saviour! Nay, to ſave them without a Saviour, whom yet he had by multitudes of Promiſes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and Prefigurations made to hope for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour!</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, If the Lord could in a conſiſtency with his veracity in threatning death to ſin, pardon ſin without either the ſinners death or his ſureties, and that the law would be (ſo) well enough contented and ſatisfied, why would the Lord put our Saviour to ſo much trouble in ſuffering a death which he might as well have eſcaped, and which he ſo earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly deſired, if it were poſſible, that he might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and all this to take off the Law from being our Head and Husband?</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, It is ſaid expreſly, That <hi>the Covenant was confirmed to Abraham of God in Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.17. which methinks muſt neceſſarily imply thus much, that the conſideration of Chriſt went into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Covenant, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> or any of the Saints under the Old-Teſtament knew it or no, as it is plain <hi>Abraham</hi> did; <hi>He rejoiced to ſee my day, and ſaw it and was glad,</hi> John 8.56. Now this Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth mightily inſiſt upon, to prove Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith to be antecedent to the giving of the Law, and therefore not to be nulled by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law; and yet this Covenant was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of God in Chriſt, that is, as I think, was ſounded upon this conſideration, that Chriſt ſhould aftervvards come into the World, and pay that price vvhich God vvould accept for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all believers
<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4. All the Fathers did drink of the ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritual drink, for the drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them; and that rock was Chriſt.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:64817:190"/>Again 4thly, Chriſt is ſaid to be the <hi>Lamb of God ſlain from the foundation of the World,</hi> Rev. 13.8. vvhich to me ſignifies thus much, that though he vvere not actually ſlain, yet he vvas reckoned by God as ſlain then, and ſo God vvas attoned for all the Saints of all ages enſuing; or to follovv the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reading of the Words in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. ſo that <hi>from the foundation of the world,</hi> ſhould refer to the vvriting the Saints Names in the Lamb's Book of Life, and not to the Lamb's being ſlain, this vvill make more for my purpoſe; for if they that vvere elected from the foundation of the World, vvere all enrolled in the Lambs Book of life, hovv ſhould this come to paſs, but becauſe they were all to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed to God by the Lambs blood? And if this opinion of perſonal Election be true, that Scripture vvould ſerve to countenance this interpretation, vvhich vve have, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>According as he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen us in him</hi> (that is Chriſt) <hi>before the foundation of the world,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of children by Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> who (in a late Book of his which he calls, <hi>An Eſſay to the explaining of the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> pag. 64.) lays ſo much weight upon this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. for proof of perſonal Election, (as to ſay, That this alone <hi>in his judgement ſeemeth ſufficient to decide the ſo much agitated Controverſie about Predeſtination</hi>) might very well have gone one ſtep further in his alteration of his mind, by acknowledging the reaſon why all the Elect ſhould be ſaid to be written in the Lamb's Book of life to be this, namely, Becauſe he was to pay the price of their Redemption, as the moſt proper and pleaſing Sacrifice for ſins that ever was offered up to God. But to proceed, as Chriſt was ſlain in Divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64817:191"/>and acceptation from the beginning of the world, (for I ſhall take liberty to follow that reading) ſo when he came into the world to be ſlain actually, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it is ſaid to be <hi>in the fulneſs of time,</hi> Gal. 4 4, 5. <hi>WHEN THE FULNESS OF TIME was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. Time went with this great birth of the Saviour of the World, near 4000. years, and then it was time Chriſt ſhould be ſent into the world to pay that debt which through the forbearance of God had been contracting for ſo long a ſpace of time.</p>
            <p>But 5thly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> for a pertinent and concluding Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-proof, I ſhall inſiſt a little upon <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, 25. 26. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy place; made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, there to appear in the preſence of God for us: Nor yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the High-Prieſt entereth into the holy place every year, with blood of others, (for then muſt he often have ſuffered SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD) but now ONCE IN THE END OF THE WORLD hath he appeared to put away fins by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himſelf.</hi> Here are ſeveral differences w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Author of this Epiſtle obſerves betwixt Chriſt out High-Prieſt, &amp; the High-Prieſt under the law, who was the moſt eminent type of Chriſt. The High-Prieſt under the law <hi>entred into the holy places made with hands;</hi> ours <hi>into heaven it ſelf.</hi> The High-Prieſt under the law entred into the holy place often, that is, though but once in the year, yet every year once, which is often in many years, ours but once in all. Again, the High-Prieſt entred <hi>with the blood of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> ours by his own blood, or <hi>the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> But yet herein there is a correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our High-Prieſt, and the legal High-Prieſt,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:64817:191"/>that as theirs went into the holy of Holies once in the end of the year for to make reconciliation for the ſins of the year paſt ſo our High-Prieſt entred into Heaven with his own blood, <hi>ONCE IN THE END OF THE WORLD,</hi> to make attonement for the ſins of the ages paſt: I think there is this alluſion in the words <hi>once in the end of the world,</hi> for that the High-Prieſt offered but once in the year, <hi>ver.</hi> 7 of this chap. ours once in all, and their once was in the end of the year, nay about the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time from the years end as our Saviour from the worlds end, as is to be ſeen <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.29. it was in the ſeventh moneth, ſeven bearing the ſame proportion to 12 (or very near it) that 4 doth to 7. taking it for granted that the world ſhould laſt but about 7000 years: therefore I would infer this alluſion to be in the words, that as theirs want, &amp;c. Beſides, there is that in this Scripture which will enforce this Analogy of the end of the year to the fore-paſt year, and the end of the world to the fore-paſt ages, and it is this; That if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour through the excellency of his perſon and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, had not had this high honor from God that his once offering ſhould ſerve inſtead of offering a hundred times over, which the Prieſts under the law were fain to do, and yet could never hereby purge away ſin as to the Conſcience: I ſay, if this once offering of our Saviour had not bin ſo highly acceptable to God as it was, he muſt (as the High-Prieſts did offer often) <hi>have ſuffered often ſince the foundation of the world,</hi> if he would have obtained pardon of ſins for thoſe for whom he obtained it; he muſt have come into the World, and ſuffered once a year, or once in an age, or elſe at the end of ſome certain term of years prefixed to him by his Father. This is the argumentation of the holy Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64817:192"/>of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> ch 9 25.
<note n="*" place="margin">Dr <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in his Par. u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theſe words, <hi>For then muſt he often have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſince the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world,</hi> hath it thus, For then he ſhould from time to time ever ſince the <hi>BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING</hi> the world have dyed many times.</note> Now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground doth this argumentation proceed, other then this, That when he ſuffered and offered himſelf, it was as a propitiation to God for the ſins of all the ages ſince the Foundation of the World? For elſe whence would it follow at all, though our Saviour ſhould have been ranked by his Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the common High-Prieſts, &amp; his offering of himſelf no more accepted for pardon, than their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the blood of Buls &amp; Goats was: I ſay, whence would it follow that he muſt have offered himſelf often ſince the foundation of the World (which certainly reſpects the ages paſt) if he was not at all to make attonement for the ſins of thoſe paſt ages? The Author of that Epiſtle would rather have ſaid (if he had not gone upon this ſuppoſition, that Chriſt offered for the ſins of the ages paſt before his ſuffering, but had onely thought that he offered for the ages to come after his ſuffering) I ſay, he would rather have expreſſed himſelf thus: If out High-Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt had not been accepted for us under the Goſpel, more highly than the legal High-Prieſts were for their people under the law, he muſt often offer as they did <hi>SINCE</hi> his firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: he muſt come and ſuffer death once in the year, and then be raiſed to offer himſelf to God: or at leaſt once in an age or ſome ſet-period of time; and this he muſt do to the end of the World; he would never have expreſſed himſelf thus; then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world. But whereas now the Apoſtle loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing upon the world as it were at an end, or drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its end, (for ſuppoſe the World laſt 70 o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64817:192"/>of a year and the continuance of it, &amp; faith he as the High Prieſt amongſt the Jews, did enter into the Holy of Holies once in the end of the year for to make an atonement for the ſins of the year paſt, ſo hath our Saviour once in the end of the world appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Again, for I have ſomewhat yet further which this phraſe <hi>now once in the end of the world</hi> will afford us, and that is this, That indeed, though it be true (and I think I have ſufficiently proved it above) that this death &amp; offering of Chriſt frees <hi>US</hi> from ſin that live after it as well as <hi>THOSE</hi> that went afore it; yet I verily believe that his death hath a more obvious reſpect to them that lived in the ages before he ſuffered than to us who came into the world after he ſuffered, though it hath indeed an influence upon us too; and the reaſon is this, for that the uſe of a Sacrifice is to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin after it is committed. When did you ever read of a Sacrifice for ſins ſlain and offered before the ſin was committed? The Sacrifices that ſhould be made thus, would rather look like a bribing the Deity to get liberty to ſin, then to make atonement for ſin. Therefore all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sacrifices that were appointed, they were appointed to be uſed after the legal uncleanneſs was contracted; and accordingly the High Prieſt that went but once into the Holy of Holyes, it was at the end of the year not at the beginning of the year. And thus our Saviour being to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſins of the world, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. he came once in the end of the world to take away ſin; ſo that his appearing thus in the end of the world ſeems more plainly to reſpect the ages paſt, than the ages which were to come; and I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if Chriſt had dyed only for the ſins of thoſe
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64817:193"/>ages that have been ſince his death, or ſhall be yet to the end of the world, he would have forborn his death till the end of the world, or the times that were near it, from this very reaſon of decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, That it is not proper to offer Sacrifice for ſin till the ſin be committed; it rather looks like the diſpenſation to ſin than making atonement for ſin.</p>
            <p>But now that Chriſt was to dye for the ſins of all the Saints in all ages before him, and that he ſtayed till the fulneſs of time, even till the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of time towards its end, (there being ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranſgreſſions already committed that were to be removed out of the way) it was no uncomely thing at all that our Saviour ſhould come and die, and offer himſelf to God when he did, though the value of the ſame Sacrifice was to reach all ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the world's end; and that eſpecially, for that there were many other ends of his coming, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the offering himſelf thus to God; he was to take upon him the Mediatorial Kingdome,
<note place="margin">Several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends of Chriſts coming beſides offering himſelf a Sacrifice for ſin.</note> to ſet up a ſpiritual Worſhip of God, by pulling down all the Jewiſh Ceremonies, making Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile one, and revealing all the myſteries that were concealed in <hi>Moſes</hi> his diſpenſation; nay, his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifice is one of the greateſt Myſteries of all, by which we are informed of God's performing his threatnings, that the threatnings of heaven are not as claps of thunder without a thunder-bolt in them; we ſee God's hatred of ſin, puniſhing it ſo ſeverely in his own Son; we ſee God's love to the world, that he would give his Son for the life of it, though he gave him up to the death, we have in his life a pattern of perfect holineſs, which is more than all precepts alone; and we ſee in our Saviour an inſtance of the Reſurrection &amp; heavenly glory;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64817:193"/>&amp; all theſe things have been of mighty inſtruction to the Saints of all ages ſince the death of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">If this phraſe, <hi>the end of the world,</hi> ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the end of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> ſtate, this will not at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice my ieference from it, that Chriſts death had reſpect unto the ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming, but rather ſtrengthen it.</note> &amp; will be to all Saints unto the end of the world; and therefore I ſay, theſe other great ends of his coming being conſidered, there is no undecency at all in his coming ſo early in the end of the world, and offering a Sacrifice that ſhould ſerve for many ages that were then to come. It was at the end of the world that he came, and therefore might very well ſerve for thoſe fewer ſucceeding ages, though it had the firſt reſpect unto the ages going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth and laſt place, I ſhall bring plain Scripture to prove that Chriſt dyed for the Saints of the ages that were paſt before his death. There are two Scriptures that ſpeak to this purpoſe; the firſt that I ſhall name is in that 9th of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> the chapter out of which I have been argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ver. 15. <hi>And for this cauſe he</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>is the Mediatour of the New Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that were under the Firſt Teſtament they which are called, &amp;c.</hi> Here it is ſaid that Chriſt by the means of his death redeemed or expiated the tranſgreſſions that were under the Firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore he dyed for the fins of thoſe that lived under the Old Teſtament. But I ſhall deal ſo faithfully with my Reader as to acquaint him with another interpretation (which is not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible) that others give of theſe words, and that is this, That our Saviour Chriſt, the Mediator of the New Teſtament or Covenant, by his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Offering redeemed and expiated thoſe ſins which could not be expiated by any Sacrifices that were appointed under the Firſt Covenant, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:64817:194"/>to that in Acts 13.39. <hi>By him</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> There being in <hi>Moſes</hi> no Sacrifices for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, <hi>thefts,</hi> murthers, &amp;c. whereas in the Chriſtian Religion there is pardon for all ſorts of ſinners by means of the death of Chriſt, if they have but the Goſpel-conditions of pardon. So that this interpretation makes the place to ſpeak of the kindes of ſins, and not of the individual or particular ſins which were committed under the firſt Covenant, that Chriſt by the means of his death hath made redemption of thoſe kinde of fins which there was no redemption for under the firſt Covenant: But I have ſomething to ask of thoſe that make this interpretation yet taking it for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, and it is this; I would fain know if any of thoſe ſins were pardoned under the Old Teſtament which here are ſaid to be redeemed by Chriſt for his followers; if they ſay they were not, then all that committed any ſuch kinde of ſins were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ever, which was untrue, witneſs <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh:</hi> if they were pardoned, as they were, then either they were expiated by ſome Sacrifice, or they were not; if thoſe that own this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſay they were not expiated by ſome Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and yet pardoned, I oppoſe, (not to mention that great argument again. That they could not be pardoned without expiation in any conſiſtency with the veracity of God in his threatning) this ſeems a ſtrange rarity in the dealings of God with us, that under the New Teſtament no ſin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned but what is expiated by the death of Chriſt, and yet under the Old Teſtament, (which was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a diſpenſation more ſevere than ours) there
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64817:194"/>the greateſt ſins ſhould be pardoned without the intervention of any Sacrifice; nay, what a ſtrange thing was it in their very diſpenſation that legal uncleanneſſes (ſuch as Leproſie and Iſſues, &amp;c. muſt be purged by ſacrifice See <hi>Lev.</hi> 14, 15. chapters. yet the greateſt ſins of all ſhould be pardoned without a ſacrifice; if therefore thoſe great ſins of Murther, Adultery, Witchcraft, Idolatry, &amp;c. were pardoned by expiation, it muſt be by this death of Chriſt to enſue in the end of the world, for there was no ſacrifice ſo much as appointed for theſe ſins; &amp; thoſe that were appointed could never reach to the purging and cleanſing of the conſcience, they only purged the fleſh from a fleſhly uncleanneſs, <hi>Heb</hi> 9.13. the blood of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hitherto hath had a virtue in it to cleanſe the conſcience; therefore I conclude, that the blood of Chriſt made expiation even for thoſe individual ſins for which there was no expiatory ſacrifice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed under the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>But to let paſs that Scripture, what will be ſaid to that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. where we have theſe words, <hi>Whom</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>God hath ſet forth</hi> (or <hi>fore-ordained,</hi> as it is in the margin) <hi>to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the REMISSION OF SINS THAT ARE PAST, through the forbearance of God, to declare (I ſay) AT THIS TIME his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus?</hi> Now I ſuppoſe there may be this ſenſe contained in theſe words, That God in the dayes of the Goſpel hath ſet forth clearly what that is by which he was alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiated and atoned for ſins, even thoſe ſins that were fore-paſt and fore-committed in the dayes
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64817:195"/>of his forbearance and long-ſuffering, that is, the darker times of the world, which times we have otherwiſe expreſſed in Acts 17.30. <hi>to be the dayes of ignorance which God winked at,</hi> (they were the dayes of God's forbearance) it was and is the blood of Chriſt, by which God alone alwaies was, and ſtill is propitiated for ſins; only then it was not ſo well known, but now God hath declared <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the <hi>Acts</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt ſins, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as well as theſe that are committed under the Goſpel, were all redeemed and expiated by the blood of Chriſt. As for any other ſenſe that is given of theſe words, I finde it only this, That the ſins that are paſt ſhould be meant of the ſins of a man's life paſt, before he comes to believe; which is a good honeſt ſenſe, for it is very true, That when a man comes to believe in Chriſt and in his blood, all the ſins of his paſt life ſhall be forgiven him: but that this is not meant by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſins that are paſt, ſeems clear to me from that term of oppoſition, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, at this time, which is certainly meant of the times of the Goſpel, in oppoſition to a former time in which thoſe ſins paſt were committed, and therefore that former time was the time before the Goſpel-dayes: which obſervation is ſtrengthened by that parallel place in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is oppoſed in the very ſame caſe to the times of Ignorance and Forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which God winked at. I have now finiſhed my proof of the ſecond Aſſertion, and ſo I have done with what I thought neceſſary to adde by way of Appendix to the former treatiſe, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of which was to ſhew how the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Juſtification came to be transferred from
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64817:195"/>Works to Grace, from the Law to Faith; in which (I muſt needs ſay) I reckon is contained the moſt: conſiderable piece of Goſpel-myſtery in the whole Book of God. The Lord give Me &amp; thee (Reader) a ſpirit of Illumination rightly to underſtand it and relliſh it. I come now to the Uſes of the whole Diſcourſe fore-going; and here I need not be ſo large as otherwiſe I might be, having inſerted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications in ſeveral places of the body of the Diſcourſe; &amp; for that the very Diſcourſe it ſelf is altogether practical, but moſt eſpecially, for that the chief end of the Diſcourſe was the diſcovery of Legality, and this I have ſo done my endeavour unto in the characters and their applications, that I ſhall have nothing at all of that to do in the Uſes. Yet ſomething I ſhall adde by way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: And firſt of all,</p>
            <p>Is it ſo (as I have above evinced) that the Law was our natural way of Juſtification which we were born under,
<note n="1" place="margin">Uſe of Inſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that we had all made our ſelves obnoxious to the wrath and curſe of it, that that had ſeiſed of us as Priſoners and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lefactors, and that yet notvvithſtanding all this we are all of us now either under the tender of Grace, or in the ſtate of Grace &amp; Favour vvith God, &amp; all this in a comly and honourable vvay for the Lavv. Then this gives us matter of Information of or rather Admiration at the ſeveral Attributes of Goodneſs, Wiſedom and Holineſs in God. I ſhall be as brief as I may be in this Uſe, becauſe theſe things are obvious.</p>
            <p>But here is certainly eminent goodneſs and grace to mankinde ſhevvn in this vvonderfull change of Juſtification from Works to Faith,
<note n="1" place="margin">Of the grace and goodneſs of God in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-way.</note> What? that vvhen vve had undone our ſelves as
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64817:196"/>to the Law, had not only weakened our ovvn ſtrengths <hi>(when we were weak Chriſt died for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly)</hi> but weakened the Law it ſelf (for <hi>the Law was made weak through our Fleſh</hi>) ſo as it could not juſtifie us, that then the Lord ſhould not only ſeek out a vvay to ſupport us from falling and ſinking, but ſet us into a better, a more eaſie, and more glorious vvay of ſalvation than we vvere in before; this is a wonder of Grace and Mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For the glory of this way;</hi> When an earthly <hi>Adam</hi> had betrayed all his truſt for his poſterity, and undone us, that then vve ſhould have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> who is the Lord from heaven, and vvho is infinitely to be preferred before the firſt, vve have a glorious repreſentation of him in his ſimilitude unto and diſſimilitude from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. from the 14. ver. to the end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For the eaſineſs of this way;</hi> That vvhen we had made (not found) the Lavv, not only diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult but impoſſible to be kept by us, ſo that the going about to fulfill that novv would be like climbing up to heaven, deſcending dovvn to hell, and getting up again, nay raiſing a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our thence, or like compaſſing the vvhole world, that inſtead of this novv vve ſhould have a vvay ſet before us ſo plain, <hi>That wayfaring men though fooles ſhall not erre therein,</hi> Eſay 38.5. ſo near us that vve need not go out of our ſelves for it, (if I may ſo expreſs it) <hi>the word is nigh thee even in thine heart and in thy mouth that thou mayeſt do it, even the word of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10.8. ſo eaſie that vve may run in it; <hi>I will run the way of thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> Pſal. 119.32. <hi>His Commandements are not grievous,</hi> 1 John 5.3. <hi>My yoke is eaſie and my bur-then
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:64817:196"/>is light,</hi> Math. 11.29, 30. This way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo eaſie to every honeſt ſoul, that it is but <hi>Ask and have, ſeek and finde, knock and it ſhall be opened,</hi> Math. 7.7. And Rom. 10.13. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved:</hi> though this eaſineſs be not found by wicked men, <hi>Knowledge is eaſie TO HIM THAT UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERST ANDETH,</hi> and to him only, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.6. Neither is it eaſie to us without the aſſiſtances of the Spirit, but theſe aſſiſtances are at hand to good men, and therefore the way of Goſpel-Juſtification and Salvation is wonderfull eaſie and delightſom; and this is a very great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the goodneſs of God.</p>
            <p>If God had propoſed the higheſt difficulties imaginable, and made it our duty to overcome them, if we would obtain the Crown of Glory propoſed to us, we ſhould have had no reaſon to complain; but when he hath taken us off from a difficult, nay an impoſſible way, (though once the true way) that we were upon, and ſet us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an eaſier way, that that is pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſom, and ſtill propoſeth the ſame or a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reward, this is grace and mercy indeed, here are riches of Mercies. Mic. 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord REQUIRE of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> What canſt thou do leſs? What wouldſt thou do elſe? Thy very work is reward enough, and yet thou ſhalt have a reward infinitely more glorious than thy work deſerves.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in this way the holineſs of God,
<note n="2" place="margin">Of the Holineſs of God.</note> that is, his hatred of and diſpleaſure againſt ſin is made very illuſtrious; in that his Law muſt be
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:64817:197"/>taken off honourably before the way of Grace muſt enter. I am ſure this is ſo for us under the Goſpel, and if under the Old Teſtament men were ſaved another way, I ſhould think it very ſtrange: but of this above.</p>
            <p>Laſtly,
<note n="3" place="margin">Of the Wiſedom of God.</note> (not to mention the power of God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in this way in the Miracles of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, raiſing Chriſt from the dead, &amp;c.) The Wiſedom of God is exceedingly manifeſted in this way of Goſpel-Juſtification. I ſhall ſhew how it appears from what hath been ſaid by &amp; by: A little proof firſt that ſo it is this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> often inſiſts upon: <hi>God hath made Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us Wiſedom and Righteouſneſs; unto them which are called Chriſt the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24, 30. The Goſpel is called <hi>the Wiſedom of God in a Myſtery, even the hidden wiſedom.</hi> Eph. 1.6, 7, 8. <hi>In whom</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>we have redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins according to the riches of his GRACE, WHEREIN he hath abounded towards us in all wiſedom and prudence.</hi> One place more, it is <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. <hi>In whom,</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>are hid all the treaſures of Wiſedom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> That is, (ſaith Dr <hi>Hammond,</hi> paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſecond and third verſes)
<q>In this courſe which hath more obſcurely been taken by God the Father under the Old Teſtament (and therefore in the ſecond verſe is called <hi>The My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God the Father</hi>) and more clearly now by God in Chriſt under the New (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>The Myſtery of Chriſt</hi>) to bring ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſalvation; in this courſe is wrapt up all the depth of divine Wiſedom imaginable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That there is great wiſedom ſhewn herein is uſually demonſtrated thus, which is a good
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:64817:197"/>way, that herein the wiſedom of God in ſaving flnners by Jeſus Chriſt diſcovers it ſelf, in that ſo many Attributes are honoured altogether, the Mercy, Holineſs, and Power of God. I ſhall inſtance further only in this, that certainly the Wiſedom of God as well as his Grace doth mightily appear in this way, for that herein God hath graciouſly accommodated himſelf to the reaſon and nature of a man, and hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that courſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.3, 4. of ſaving men in this way of Grace, which is moſt likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; <hi>I taught Ephraim alſo to go, taking them by the armes, I drew them with cords of a man with bands of love, and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jawes, and I laid meat unto them.</hi> This Scripture may well be applyed to Gods way of ſaving men upon Goſpel terms; he takes off the yoke of the Law from our jawes, ſets meat before us, whereas the Law afforded us nothing but ſtones inſtead of bread, and for fiſh gave us ſcorpions. The Lord here draws us with the cords of a man and with the bands of Love; in that true winning way which is ſuited to the nature of a man. <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf</hi> (ſaith the Lord to a poor ſoul) <hi>but in me is thine help, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſ</hi> 13.9. Thou art weak, relye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon me who am the Rock of Ages; if thou haſt committed ſins, repent and turn unto mee and they ſhall be forgiven thee, only thou muſt ſet thy ſelf faithfully to obey my commands; and whereas thou faileſt through weakneſs, I am ready to pardon, and now that thou maiſt have life upon theſe terms, upon theſe rational terms, <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions whereby ye have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, and make yee a new heart and a new spirit, for
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64817:198"/>why will ye dye O houſe of Iſrael; for I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of him that dyeth, ſaith the Lord God: wherefore turn your ſelves and live yee,</hi> Ezek. 18.31, 32. The Lord obviates all the objections that we can make; if we ſay it is hard to walk with God in the obedience to his commands, he promiſeth ſtrength; if we ſay, But what if I ſhould fail in ſuch and ſuch inſtances of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? why (ſaith the Lord) whileſt there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a ſincerity I will pardon; if any man doth ſin, <hi>wee have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> 1 John 2.1.</p>
            <p>Thus the way of God in the Goſpel is highly rational; there is a variety of ſtrong arguments in the way of Grace, eſpecially in the Goſpel diſpenſation, to perſwade our faith, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to perſwade our obedience. Dr <hi>Moor</hi> in his <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſs</hi> makes mention of and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifts upon ſeven ſeveral Goſpel-powers, by which the Goſpel becomes effectual to the bringing of man into a ſtate of ſalvation, and ſo as certainly of juſtification, all which he reckons up <hi>pag.</hi> 392, <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. the two firſt he makes,
<q>The evidence that we are to be inwardly and really righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and not only ſo, but in an extraordinary manner; the five laſt are, the promiſe of the Spirit through Chriſt's interceſſion, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, the meditation on his Paſſion, on his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and on the laſt Judgment. Moſt of which (as it is evident) work morally, that is, upon a man's reaſon; and he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 410. <hi>ad ſin.</hi>
               </q>
               <q>That God in his infinite Wiſedom hath traced out ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in Chriſtian Religion as is moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to gain ſouls to himſelf.</q> And this
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:64817:198"/>certainly all thoſe Divines will acknowledge that are for converſion to be ordinarily effected by moral ſuaſion; for though the Holy Ghoſt himſelf ſhould repreſent the arguments to our ſouls which we are to be moved by, yet if it be only repreſented in order to prevailing upon us in a way of perſwaſion, it is <hi>only the reaſon of a man</hi> that is to cloſe with them, and therefore they will never prevail except they be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated and ſuited to <hi>a man's</hi> reaſon; nay, the more lively and truly they are repreſented unto a man's ſoul, the leſs affecting will they be by how much the leſs rational they are. And what Dr <hi>Moor</hi> afferts of the Chriſtian Religion, that it is ſo accommodated to man's nature to prevail upon it, hath been alwaies true in the way of grace and faith in that meaſure in which it was at any time intelligible. And therefore for theſe men that ſpeak againſt reaſon in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they do but go about to unman us whileſt they pretend to make us Chriſtians; and they rob God of the glory of his Wiſedom, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of which, as it is given by us, cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe rightly and acceptably aſcribed, then as we underſtand how this Wiſedom diſcovers it ſelf in the ſeveral deſignes and effects of it; which underſtanding is by no other faculty in us but that of our Reaſon, though it need be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated and ſtrengthened by the ſpirit of God in ſuch acts of our underſtanding. The Wiſedom of God therefore in this Goſpel-way of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is very conſpicuous, not only in that God hath in this way made many Attributes illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous together, but in that the way it ſelf is ſuch as is moſt appoſite to attain the end; <hi>viz.</hi> to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64817:199"/>men, which is the higheſt commendation of the prudence of any deſigne. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be perſwaded to admire the Wiſedom and Prudence wherein God hath abounded towards us in this way of Faith, which certainly if we ſtudyed more, we ſhould be abundantly more affected with, even from our own convictions of the wiſedom of it, and made to cry out with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>

Is it ſo, that the Lord hath remitted of the rigour of his Law, nay, that he hath taken off the Law wholly from requiring an account of thoſe that are married unto Chriſt, as being their Husband no longer? Is the condition of Juſtification altered from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring obedience to faith and ſincerity in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? then here is comfort for all faithfull ſincere hearts. Art thou honeſt to God? haſt thou no <hi>Delilah</hi> in thy boſome? art thou faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the intereſt of Chriſt and his Saints? thou art ſafe, thou art ſecure; it is not neceſſary that thou be in the higheſt form of Chriſtians; 'tis true it were well if thou wert there, and it is thy duty to endeavour it, but it is not abſolutely neceſſary to thy being a Saint or in favour with God.</p>
            <p>There are of all ſorts and ſizes,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> more of this pag. 202, 203. above</note> of all ranks and ages that are accepted with God.

Art thou in any diſtreſs or trouble at any time, either from without, from men; or from within, by the bufferings of Satan? turn in preſently upon thy ſoul, and examine, ſee how thou haſt lived, and what thy preſent frame of heart is. 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>Our rejoicing is this, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of our conſcience, that IN SIMPLICITY &amp; GODLY SINCERITY, not with fleſhly wiſedom,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:64817:200"/>but by the grace of God we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> Now if thou haſt ſuch a teſtimony as this from thine own conſcience, thou maiſt conclude thou art in the favour of God, and that therefore <hi>all things ſhall work together unto thee for good;</hi> but herein do not deceive thy ſelf with an imagined honeſty of heart to God, as many do, but deal faithfully with thy ſelf in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination whether thou have a ſincerity or no. If I ſhould here give all the marks of ſincerity that I could finde throughout the Scripture, I ſhould not be impertinent in ſo doing, but yet ſeeing that hath been done well by many, I ſhall forbear; I ſhall only ſay this, that if thou ſetteſt thy ſelf any boundary or ſtint to thy attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in holineſs, ſhort of perfection thou art ſo far inſincere; or if thou avoideſt any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (which thou canſt by any means certainly underſtand to be an opportunity) of honouring God, thou art ſo far inſincere. Laſtly, if thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt way to ſin in the little degrees or appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, thou art ſo far inſincere; and if the intereſt of the fleſh or of the world prevail in thy heart above the intereſt of God and Chriſt, thou art altogether infincere, whatever good deſire; and good affections thou maiſt have in thy heart.</p>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:64817:200"/>ſhew thee my faith by my works.</hi> For though I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth not ſpeak only in that Chapter of the demonſtration of Faith by Works (but alſo of real Juſtification before God by Works, as they are a part of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goſpel-juſtification, according to the 14. ver. of that Chap. <hi>If a man ſay he hath faith and not works, SHALL FAITH SAVE HIM?</hi>) yet it is certain that he ſpeaks there alſo of the demonſtration of Faith by Works; and both theſe deſignes (I think) may be as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in that chap. of <hi>James,</hi> as in the 24 of <hi>Mat.</hi> we may underſtand our Saviour ſpeaking of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the end of the World.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of giving marks and ſignes of true faith, I ſhall rather proceed to an uſe of Exhortation unto the high and frequent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Faith, which when we are engaged in, we ſhall have marks and ſignes enough to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our faith by.</p>

How is God known in the world in any way with ſuch an honourable reflection as by men's truſting in him? To truſt our own wit, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntrivance, and endeavours only in what we do, is as much as in us lyes to put God out of the world; I am ſure it is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without God in the world; whereas truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him for all is the only advancing the Lord upon his Throne of Sovereignty &amp; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>

               </gap>rſon, yet partaking of Fleſh and Blood like us, we might have a fit inſtrument and help, or mediate object for our faith to work upon: firſt upon him and by him, upon God himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that place once already mentioned. 1 Pet. 1.21. <hi>Who by him</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>do believe in God that raiſed him up from the dead, and gave him
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:64817:203"/>glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</hi> I come now to the matter of the Exhortation it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Be exhorted therefore to be ſtrong in faith, that is, in the acts of aſſent and the acts of affiance; for theſe (as I take it) are the two chief proper acts of faith, though after I have ended the Exhortation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe two, I ſhall give one notion of faith more under which we are to be exhorted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe faith:</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Aſſent; ſo faith is taken, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> and Mark 1.15. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the Goſpel,</hi> that is, the doctrine of the Goſpel; and (to mention but one place more) Rom. 14.23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin;</hi>
               <note place="margin">This noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal faith, where the word faith ſignifies an act, is the moſt common notion of faith in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that is, (as the former part of the verſe, <hi>he that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of faith,</hi> carrieth it) whatſoever a man doth without a <hi>ſound perſwaſion</hi> in his minde that it is lawfull to do it, he ſinneth in that action. This is the firſt notion therefore of faith, namely, the aſſent to any Propoſition, though more accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the aſſent to a teſtimony; but yet you ſee the Scripture-notion of faith is ſomewhat larger than that of the Schools, namely, the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of or aſſent unto the truth of a Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore if thou wilt be <hi>rich in faith,</hi> be thou rich in truth, in thy aſſent unto truths, that is, truths in Religion; for though it be faith to believe there is ſuch a place as <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> yet my deſigne confines me here to truths in Religion: Be thou rich therefore in aſſent to divine truths, and that, whether they
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64817:203"/>be clear by the light of nature, or revelation; for aſſent to truths that are clear even by the light of Nature is called Faith by the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 11.6. where <hi>to believe that God is,</hi> (which certainly is clear by the light of Nature) is called Faith, as I have ſhewn above, <hi>pag.</hi> 291. I ſay, be rich in thy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto all truths as near as thou canſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be clear by the light of Nature or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Revelation. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſedom,</hi> Col. 3.16. So <hi>Chriſt ſhall dwell in your hearts by faith;</hi> for according to thy light and knowledge and aſſent unto truths, ſo will be thy heart, affections, and converſation: he that hath a large light may have a large heart; whereas thoſe that have but a narrow light, and a ſcanty knowledge, can have but a lower and a more limited ſphear and compaſs to act in for God. And if it happen (as often it doth) that they that know little yet do more than many that know a great deal; this comes not from any advantage of the honeſt man's ignorance, but from the folly and careleſneſs of thoſe perſons that are knowing, and their want of firm aſſent to the notions of truth which float in their brains.
<note place="margin">I am but a little care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full here of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing betwixt <hi>Knowledge</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſſent,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits of an Uſe.</note> Enlarge thy minde with knowledge, and thou getteſt a larger field of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſervice than otherwiſe thou canſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have: for thou muſt firſt know thy duty before thou canſt do it rightly; for he that doth the beſt actions in the world, not knowing that they are good, pleaſeth neither God nor man; they are only the actions of the man, they are not humane or manly actions, as the Schools diſtinguiſh. Yea, though thou doſt a good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64817:204"/>yet if thou doubteſt whether it be good or no, thou ſinneſt in doing this good action; becauſe, <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi> For this largeneſs of faith by aſſent, ſee that laſt chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter where I ſhew how we ſhould endeavour to know much of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But then withall take this advice too in thy faith of aſſent, do not only endeavour to get a true light and perſwaſion of the truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of things or actions, but get it as firmly rooted and as clear as ever thou canſt, this will be a mighty advantage to thee; for if thou haſt only a glimmering light, a little cloud will ſoon darken it; if thou getteſt but a faint perſwaſion, a ſmall objection will quickly turn it into doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: therefore get thy faith firmly built, that thou maiſt be firm and ſtable in thy faith and perſwaſion; <hi>Be not like children toſſed to and fro with every winde of doctrine,</hi> Eph. 4.14. <hi>Be not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in underſtanding; in malice be ye children, but in underſtanding be ye men,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.20. I think we have ſufficient experience in theſe times of of the ſore evil of a weak perſwaſion about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, by the running up and down of ſo many from one party to another, till at laſt they have <hi>made ſhipwrack of their faith,</hi> (that is, ſaith doctrinal) as well as of <hi>their conſciences,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly; As to this part of faith which lyes in aſſent, as we ought to endeavour that it be large and ſtrong, ſo we muſt eſpecially be wary that we fail not in our aſſent, and that a firm aſſent to thoſe truths that are moſt important.

               </gap> ſhould be; yet all muſt look to it that they be well eſtabliſht in foundation-truths, ſuch as the Death of Chriſt and his Expiation of ſins, the Reſurrection of the body and the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we muſt be ſure to <hi>continue</hi> in this <hi>faith, grounded and ſettled, and not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel,</hi> Col. 1.23. <hi>Rooted and built up in him</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>and ſtabliſhed in the faith as we have been taught,</hi> (that is, Faith doctrinal) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in that great Foundation of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. And truly I think there hath been no greater weakening of our faith in foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-truths than the multiplying of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals; for taking off that weight and ſtreſs which we ſhould lay upon thoſe few fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of the Faith of Chriſt that are really ſo, and laying it upon things non-funnamental, muſt needs make us unſettled from the foundation.

            <p n="2">2ly, For that part of Faith which lyes in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64817:205"/>of no other than ſome kinde of affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; ſuch as this, that for that blood ſake the Lord is ready to be propitious to me if I have the Goſpel-conditions of Juſtification: and in this ſenſe (namely) of affiance, I have general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken faith throughout this Treatiſe; and the reaſon is this, For that this is the end of a dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faith or a faith of aſſent, and cannot be conceived without it, as that may without this; not that I think there can be a thorough dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faith without this of
<note n="*" place="margin">Faith of affiance is known in the Old Teſtament by the name of <hi>truſting,</hi> as faith of Aſſent is known in the New Teſtament by the name of <hi>believing;</hi> it it alſo expreſſed by <hi>ſtaying one's ſelf, leaning upon confidence in God.</hi> See <hi>Ball</hi> of Faith, pag 24, 25, 26. who is large and clear upon it.</note> Affiance: but yet, ſeeing one may conceive them apart, though they are never ſeparated, I took the ſureſt courſe in uſing the word Faith in this ſenſe, namely, for the faith of Affiance, ſo including both una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably.</p>
            <p>Look well therefore to this part of your faith, this makes uſe of all the truths and promiſes which you aſſent unto for true, and brings them down to your particular caſe: as now for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; Doeſt thou aſſent to this for a truth, that God is good to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even to ſuch as are of a clean heart? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. why then do thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve for the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, that God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and do it good, notwithſtanding all the ſufferings that are brought upon it; and do thou cleanſe thy heart, and believe that God will be good to thee. The former (<hi>viz.</hi> to believe the Promiſe true) is a faith of Aſſent, this a faith of Affiance; ſo again, for any particular
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64817:205"/>trouble that the people of God may be under, or that thou maiſt be under, believe, and doubt not but God will with this trouble make a way to eſcape, that they and thou maiſt be able to bear it, and that it ſhall work for good. When thou prayeſt in any caſe of publick calamity, as of Famine, or of Peſtilence, &amp;c. thou muſt pray in faith, and then thou haſt no other way but to apply general promiſes (which thou believeſt true by a faith of Aſſent) to the particular caſe by a faith of Affiance, ſo expecting the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of them. When thou prayeſt for any ſick perſon, or for thy ſelf, upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it is the general promiſe muſt give thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to expect the mercy in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it; which expectation certainly muſt be underſtood to be affiance, or at leaſt ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act than meerly aſſent to the promiſe as from God.</p>
            <p>In this part of Faith therefore, namely Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, 1. Endeavour to be rich and abundant; 2. Be ſtrong and intenſe. 1. Be abundant; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your faith as far as you can unto all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Church, or any particular perſons whoſe caſes you may have occaſion to know.</p>
            <p>St <hi>Paul</hi> had upon him <hi>the care of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.28. but think you he could ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it without <hi>caſting this care upon God</hi> by faith? See an act of faith for his beloved <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. 16 20. <hi>God ſhall bruiſe or tread Satan under your feet ſhortly;</hi> and we finde how every Church to whom he wrote did partake of his moſt ardent prayers, (as we may ſee in the beginning of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Epiſtle) which without faith would have been utterly ineffectual. Nay, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:64817:206"/>was of ſo noble a ſpirit, that he did not only intereſſe himſelf in the concernments of whole Churches, but of every particular perſon that he could come to know of, <hi>Who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> &amp; could he eaſe himſelf of this trouble but by faith? <hi>Daniel</hi> he underſtood by <hi>books the number of the weeks</hi> wherein the Jews were to ſuffer Captivity, and the time of their Deliverance, and did he not adde prayers to his knowledge, and faith to his prayers? <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2, 3. Was it not for his prayers of faith, <hi>looking towards Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> Dan. 6.10. that he was caſt into the Lions Den? and did not the ſame faith that ſet him a praying, and opened his mouth, <hi>ſtop the mouthes of the Lions?</hi> Heb. 11.33.</p>
            <p>Again, for faith for particular perſons, I have often obſerved already, that the Centurion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved for his Servant, the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> for her Daughter, the Palſie-man's friends for him, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſervant for his Maſter's Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.14. and it is ſaid, <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick,</hi> Jam. 5.15. Therefore enlarge your faith and bowels of mercies for as many as you can.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Or if you cannot concern your faith ſo largely or univerſally as a <hi>Daniel,</hi> or a <hi>Paul</hi> might do, (as ſome men and ſome Saints are of a more noble ſpirit and faith than other men, then other Saints) yet be ſure look to it, that whatever you do you mixe faith in the doing of it. Whether you pray for your ſelves, or others, for Churches or particular perſons, you muſt pray in faith; if you hear the Word, you muſt <hi>mixe faith in the hearing of it;</hi> if thou art under temptations, &amp; findeſt great weakneſs &amp; infirmity, thou muſt glory in it by faith, that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64817:206"/>here is an opportunity for the <hi>power of Chriſt to reſt upon thee: When I am weak</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>then am I ſtrong;</hi> which could not be true in the ſame ſenſe in which he was weak, but only thus, that when he was weak in himſelf, then he found Chriſt moſt ready at at hand to help him, as he explains himſelf in that Scripture, 2 Cor. 12.9, 10. <hi>If any of you lack wiſedom let him ask it of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 1.5. <hi>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering,</hi> as it follows in ver 6. But I ſhall not need to inſtance in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes wherein faith will ſtead us after ſo many reckoned together by the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 11.33, 34, 35: there are caſes perſonal and national, in proſperity as <hi>victories,</hi> adverſity as <hi>impriſonments, mockings, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, death;</hi> there are caſes of Kings, Judges, Prophets, private men, and even of women; only in the general therefore be ſure whatever you do, do it in faith, let your whole life be a life of faith; perhaps you may not have ſuch a large ſphear of action as ſome other more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints, you may not be of ſuch a large ſoul as ſome others, but for what comes through your hands to do, it muſt be done in faith; in this we muſt all imitate the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>The life that I now live in the fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> the life that I live, the words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> faith of the Son of God. Mannage all thihe affairs, perform all thy actions in faith; whatſoever action thou haſt to tranſact, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64817:207"/>it be of a ſpiritual, or a more ſecular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, expect wiſedom, and ſtrength, and ſucceſs from God.</p>
            <p>And endeavour to be ſtrong, intenſe, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous in all the actions of thy faith, as it is ſaid <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. and or a direction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that your faith may be ſtrong as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s was, take the courſe that he did; if there be great difficulties appear in the way that thou art in, yet knowing that thou art in Gods way, look away from the difficulties that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſult only with the power and goodneſs &amp; faithfulneſs of God, and this ſhield of Faith (which above all the pieces of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual armour we are cautioned to make uſe of) will quench all the fiery darts of diſcouraging temptations. <hi>Abraham</hi> was put upon as difficult acts of faith as ever any man was, and if he would have conſidered all difficulties, he might eaſily have been diſcouraged; but it is ſaid, <hi>He CONSIDERED NOT his own body now dead, nor yet the deadneſs of Sarah's womb,</hi> ver. 19. and therefore ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbelief.</p>
            <p>The third Notion in which Faith is taken in Scripture,
<note place="margin">Faith ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for fidelity or faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God.</note> and in which thou art to be exhorted to the exerciſe of faith, is that of <hi>Fidelity</hi> or <hi>Faithfulneſs to God,</hi> as it ſtands oppoſed to wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and unfixedneſs of heart in the profeſſion of his name and Goſpel; thus it is taken in James 15.6. <hi>If any of you lack wiſedom, let him ask of God who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: If a man think to receive any thing
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64817:207"/>of God,</hi> (wiſedom or any ſuch thing) <hi>let him ask in faith.</hi> What is this faith? It is not meant of a particular certain expectation of that which we ask, for that is underſtood in the phraſe <hi>think to receive,</hi> ver. 7. but it is meant of truſtineſs and fixedneſs of heart to God without wavering, as all the three verſes 6, 7, 8. carry it; <hi>for he that wavereth is like a wave of the ſea driven with the wind and toſſed: A double-minded man is unſtable in all his wayes;</hi> now this double-mindedneſs and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering cannot be meant of the want only of a certain expectation of that particular thing which we ask in prayer; for though we ſhould be wanting in this particular and ſin in it, yet it would not follow, that we <hi>were unſtable in all our wayes, that we were like a wave of the ſea driven with the wind and toſſed,</hi> or <hi>that we were double-minded,</hi> for that is a word that plainly ſignifies hypocriſie. Beſides, as I have intimated, it is plainly ſaid in the 7 verſe, that ſuch a man that is a waverer, a double-minded man, <hi>muſt not think to receive any thing of the Lord;</hi> now if double-mindedneſs and wavering here, which are made the oppoſites of faith, were taken for miſdoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive that thing which we pray for; the paraphraſe would be thus, Let not him that doubteth whether he ſhall receive his petition think to receive his petition, which were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs admiration; for that while he doubteth whether he ſhall receive what he prayes for, he cannot think he ſhall receive it. But now there is a full and ſtrong ſenſe in the other expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That if a man pray for wiſedom, or for any other thing, &amp; at the ſame time is unfixed in his
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:64817:208"/>heart to the profeſſion of the name and Goſpel of Chriſt (as it is known many of the Jews, to whom the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> directs this Ep ſtle, were) let not that man think to receive any thing of the Lord. If thou expecteſt or but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt that the Lord ſhould hear thy prayer at any time, do thou come to him with <hi>thorough purpoſe of heart to cleave cloſe to him;</hi> do not bring with thee an heart and an heart, a double mind into his preſence; for he hates a lukewarm ſoul, that is neither for God nor for the world, worſe than he doth one that is ſtark cold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.15, 16. if thou comeſt with ſuch an inſtability, wavering, and unfixedneſs of heart to God, never think to receive any thing from him; thou maiſt pray and pray thy heart out, and do by thy ſelf as <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts did by themſelves to make their God to hear them, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.26, 28. but thou ſhalt not be heard.</p>
            <p>And what the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith here in the matter of Prayer, I may ſay in the matter of faith of Aſſent and Affiance, both before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, That though you had the largeſt &amp; ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt aſſent to divine truths that ever any in the world had, or as the Apoſtle makes the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 Cor. 13.2. <hi>Though you had the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and underſtood all Myſteries and all Knowledge;</hi> you, though for affiance you had <hi>ALL FAITH</hi> (that is, ſaith Dr <hi>Hammond,</hi> the higheſt degree of that faith by which Miracles are wrought) <hi>ſo as to remove mountains;</hi> nay, I will adde, though thou hadſt the ſtrongeſt affiance and truſt in the mercies of God for the pardon of ſins that ever any man had, yet imagine all this but ſeparated
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64817:208"/>from that integrity and honeſty of faith which is here required in this place of <hi>James,</hi> and it is all worth nothing. Thou muſt be a man fixed to God in thy reſolutions to walk with him and ſerve him, or elſe never think to faſten upon any of his promiſes, nor to receive any anſwer to thy prayers.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee is a notion of faith which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſincerity, or faithfulneſs; and this <hi>Conradus Bergius</hi> Profeſſor at <hi>Breme</hi> in his <hi>Praxis Catholica,</hi> pag. 15, 16, 17. aſſerts and proves to be the firſt notion of Faith, pag. 17. <hi>Ad hanc quidem fidei ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificationem, qua fidelitatem ſignificat, omnes caeterae revocari poſſunt;</hi> that is, Unto this ſignification or notion of faith wherein it ſignifies Fidelity or Faithfulneſs, all the other ſignifications of faith may be reduced. Yet becauſe (as the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor acknowledgeth in the ſame page) <hi>Aſſenſio, quam adhibemus dicenti, ita uſu invaluit pro ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione fidei, ut propria habeatur, nihilque cedat illi quae ex prima impoſitione videtur deſcendere;</hi> that is, Aſſent to the authority and truth of the ſpeaker is ſo commonly uſed to expreſs the notion of faith, that it is taken for the moſt proper noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, as alſo for that <hi>fiducia</hi> or affiance <hi>ad differentiam ſicque ad dignitatem &amp; conſequenter ad eſſentiam fidei pertinet,</hi> as the ſame Author ſpeaks, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. that is, affiance or truſt belongs to the difference and ſo to the definition and conſequently to the eſſence of faith, for this reaſon that the firm aſſent to any teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, even that of God himſelf, requires an affection in him that aſſents; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Faith defined (as he ſaith) by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raus,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:64817:209"/>aſſenſum fiducialem,</hi> a fiducial aſſent. I ſay, for theſe reaſons, from the notation of the word partly, but eſpecially for that, (though this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and faithfulneſs be a Scripture-notion of faith, as is to be ſeen in this place of <hi>James,</hi> yet) it is rarely uſed in this ſenſe in the Scripture; I have taken faith as juſtifying in that ſenſe as it ſignifies aſſent or affiance, &amp; chiefly for affiance, for the reaſons given above, <hi>pag.</hi> 346. But however having urged the practice of faith, as you ſee from the Scripture in this 3 Notion likewiſe (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
               <hi>Bergius</hi> ſayes is the firſt) as it ſignifies Sincerity or Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, I ſhall not need to make any new exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which otherwiſe I ſhould be engaged to do from the fore-going diſcourſe) unto ſincerity or ſincere obedience, which is the other part of the condition of Goſpel juſtification. I might adde as a great particular of the Exhortation to the exerciſe of faith, that you muſt be ſure to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe frequent and vigorous acts upon Chriſt and his blood; but of this I have ſpoken at large in the laſt Character.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore this uſe, and ſo the whole Treatiſe, if thou be rich in knowledge, and firm in thy aſſent unto divine truths, copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſtrong in acts of affiance upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power and goodneſs exhibited in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of the Word, and to this addeſt, or rather makeſt to precede a ſincerity of heart in the ſervice of God; that is, in ſumme, if thou be a great believer, (thou mayeſt not perhaps work Miracles, but) thou ſhalt be a wonderful Chriſtian, and ſhalt be able to do greater things than it was to do Miracles when
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:64817:209"/>they were in uſe, for wicked men could work Miracles, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.22. Thou ſhalt be eminently uſefull unto the Church, to thy Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations &amp; Acquaintance, &amp; unto thine own ſoul; thou ſhalt be fit to ſtand in the gap upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for others; &amp; for thy ſelf, thou ſhalt free thy mind of all thy cares, all thy buſineſſes ſhall ſucceed; thou ſhalt have all thy graces flouriſhing &amp; vigorous; thou ſhalt by thy frequent actings of faith in prayer at laſt get ſuch liberty of acceſs to the throne of Grace, ſuch fellowſhip and communion with the Father and the Son as to be unto God and Chriſt in the quality of a Friend, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.23. which we know occaſioned intimate communications from God to him as well as from him to God. Gen. 18.17. <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?</hi> So our Saviour ſaith to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; <hi>Henceforth I call you not ſervants but friends, for the ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doth,</hi> John 15.15. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord,</hi> both of his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and Providence ſhall <hi>be with thee,</hi> Pſal. 25.14. In a word, be but much in the exerciſe of faith, and you ſhall need but little more to enquire into your ſelves what evidences you have of the favour of God to you, than one at noon-day needs evidence that the Sun ſhines; be but much in believing, and ordinarily (I ſpeak not of extraordinary diſpenſations) ye ſhall have <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. this you may ſee at large above in the third Character, <hi>pag</hi> 187. But I do not pretend here in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs of a Uſe to ſpeak to all that may be ſaid of the life of Faith, either to the kindes
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:64817:210"/>of its acts, the bleſſed effects of it, all the caſes about it, motives to it, or directions in it, this would fill a large Treatiſe; See <hi>Ball</hi> of the Life of Faith. I ſhall conclude all with that of the Pſalmiſt 37.3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord and do good;</hi> be large and firme in thy aſſent to divine truths, be ſtrong and vigorous in thy acts of Truſt and Affiance, and be faithfull to thy God, <hi>and thou ſhalt dwell in the Land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed;</hi> verily thou ſhalt be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, verily thou ſhalt be ſaved.</p>
